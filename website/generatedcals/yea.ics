 nnounce that MIT's greatest immersive technology hackathon is returning 
 this January! We've recently rebranded with a cool new name: MIT Reality 
 Hack\n\n\n\nMIT Reality Hack is a 5 day event held every January that comp
 rises of thought leaders\, brand mentors and creators\, participants\, stu
 dents\, and technology lovers to come together and attend tech workshops\,
  talks\, discussions\, fireside chats\, collaborations\, hacking\, and mor
 e. Participants of various backgrounds and all skill levels attend from al
 l over the world.\n	\n	Reality Hack starts with workshops and bringing tog
 ether teams. Hacking then takes over for 3 days\, with mentors\, hardware\
 , and snacks to guide the way. It culminates in judging and a public expo 
 to bring to light some of the amazing projects and ideas developed.\n\n\n\
 nLast year we hosted over 400 hackers representing a diverse cohort of n
 ew and experienced XR creators. This event provides a great opportunity
  for attendees to develop fresh ideas\, make new connections in the indus
 try\, and build on the latest hardware and tools from company sponsors.

DESCRIPTION:<p><em><strong>When and How Fracture Nucleates and Propagates 
 in Rubber</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Twenty years in
  since their introduction\, it is now plain that the regularized formulati
 ons dubbed as phase-field of the variational theory of brittle fracture of
  Francfort and Marigo (1998) provide a powerful macroscopic theory to desc
 ribe and predict the propagation of cracks in (linear and non-linear) elas
 tic brittle materials under arbitrary quasistatic loading conditions. Over
  the past ten years\, the ability of the phase-field approach to also poss
 ibly describe and predict crack nucleation has been under intense investig
 ation.</p>\n<p>The first of two objectives of this talk is to establish th
 at the existing phase-field approach to fracture at large — irrespective
 ly of its particular version — is fundamentally incomplete to model crac
 k nucleation. This is because the approach is purely energetic and cannot 
 account for one essential ingredient that is not energetic but rather stre
 ss-based: the strength of the material.</p>\n<p>The second objective is to
  introduce — in the general context of finite elasticity — an amendmen
 t that renders a phase-field theory capable of modeling crack nucleation i
 n general\, be it from large pre-existing cracks\, small pre-existing crac
 ks\, smooth and non-smooth boundary points\, or within the bulk of structu
 res subjected to arbitrary quasistatic loadings. The central idea is to im
 plicitly account for the presence of the inherent microscopic defects in t
 he material — whose defining macroscopic manifestation is precisely the 
 strength of the material — through the addition of an external driving f
 orce in the equation governing the evolution of the phase field.</p>\n<p>T
 o illustrate the descriptive and predictive capabilities of the proposed t
 heory\, the last part of the talk will be devoted to deploy the theory to 
 simulate the nucleation and propagation of fracture in a class of conspicu
 ous experiments\, that of rubber bands subject to tensile loading. The sim
 ulations for very short rubber bands will explain the famous poker-chip ex
 periments of Gent and Lindley (1959)\, whereas those for long rubber bands
  will explain when and how the famed rubber bands invented by Stephen Perr
 y in the 1840s break.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p><span style='font-size: 14pt\;'><em>Femto-magnetism meets s
 pintronics: Towards integrated magneto-photonics</em></span></p>\n<p>Novel
  schemes for optically controlling ferromagnetic order at a femtosecond ti
 me scale receive great scientific interest. In the strongly non-equilibriu
 m regime\, it has become possible not only to quench magnetic order\, but 
 even to deterministically switch the magnetic state by a single femtosecon
 d laser pulses. Moreover\, it has been shown that pulsed laser excitation 
 can induce spin currents over several to tens of nanometers. This developm
 ent triggered a merge of the fields of ‘femto-magnetism’ and spintroni
 cs – opening up a fascinating playground for novel physical phenomena. I
 n this lecture I will discuss the underlying principles\, but also envisio
 n their exploitation in THz magnonics and integrated spintronic-photonic m
 emories.</p>\n<p>After a brief review of the field\, mechanisms for ultraf
 ast loss of magnetic order upon fs laser heating as well as all-optical sw
 itching will be explained. Next\, different processes that give rise to la
 ser-induced spin currents will be distinguished. In particular I will addr
 ess experiments that have demonstrated laser-induced spin transfer torque 
 on a free magnetic layer. These fs spin currents are absorbed within a few
  nanometers\, providing ideal conditions for exciting and exploring THz sp
 in waves. Finally\, it will be argued that synthetic\, layered ferrimagnet
 s provide an ideal platform for combining fs optical control with advanced
  spintronic functionality. It will be shown how magnetic bits can be writt
 en ‘on-the-fly’ by fs laser pulses in a so-called magnetic racetrack\,
  where they are immediately transported by a dc current. Such schemes may 
 lead to a novel class of integrated photonics\, in which information is tr
 ansferred back and forth between the photonic and magnetic domain without 
 any intermediate electronic steps.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Biography: 
 </strong>Bert Koopmans is a Full Professor and Group leader of the group P
 hysics of Nanostructures at the Department of Applied Physics of the Eindh
 oven University of Technology (TU/e). He obtained his PhD from the Univers
 ity of Groningen in 1993. After a postdoc at the Radboud University Nijmeg
 en\, he spent three years as a Humboldt Fellow at the Max-Planck Institute
  for Solid State Physics in Stuttgart. His present research activities are
  in spintronics\, nanomagnetism and ultrafast spin- & magnetization-dynami
 cs. He participates in the TU/e Institute for Integrated Photonics\, where
  he initiates research on integrated magneto-photonics\, and is a member o
 f the board of the Dutch NanoLabNL. His research is aimed to contribute to
  future energy-efficient and versatile information technology.</p>

DESCRIPTION:\nCarolina Sanín (Bogotá\, 1973) is author of the novels Los
  niños (The Children\, Laguna Libros 2014\, Siruela 2015) and Todo en otr
 a parte (Everything Elsewhere\, Seix Barral\, 2005)\, the short stories Po
 nqué y otros cuentos (Pound cake and another stories\, Norma 2010\, Lagun
 a Libros 2016)\, the humorous text Yosoyu (Yosoyu\, Destiempo\, 2013)\, a 
 children book Dalia (Dalia\, Norma\, 2010) and the essay Alfonso X\, el re
 y sabio (Alfonso X\, the Wise King\, Panamericana\, 2009). Her texts have 
 appeared in magazines and anthologies in Latin America\, the United States
  and Spain. Between 2009 and 2012 she held a Sunday column in the newspape
 r ‘El Espectador’. Currently\, she publishes a monthly column in the m
 agazine ‘Arcadia’. She obtained a Ph.D in Hispanic Literature from Yal
 e University where she specialized in medieval literature. She also has wo
 rked as a translator and a professor at the State University of New York-P
 urchase College and in the Universidad de los Andes\, in Colombia.\nhttps:
 //www.viclit.com/en/carolina-sanin-2/\n\nAlba Triana's work emerges from a
  deep interest in how nature intrinsically operates. Universal laws of cha
 nce\, and natural behaviors and phenomena frame her approach to art/music 
 making. She engages in creative methods that are holistic\, complex\, and 
 multidimensional\, crossing the boundaries of a diverse set of fields. \n\
 nHer artistic production is hybrid and takes a variety of forms\, includin
 g interactive musical installations\, resonating spaces\, sound and light 
 sculptures\, and vibrational objects. These pieces\, expressed in both spa
 ce and time\, are heard\, walked through\, and seen. \n\nIn the past 10 ye
 ars\, the fields of the sonic and the visual have become unified in her wo
 rk\, exploring interactions among different types of waves\, as well as re
 sonance phenomena in acoustic spaces and physical bodies that emit sound a
 nd/or light. Most recently\, she has experimented with electromagnetism as
  a means of observation of non-perceptible entities.\nhttps://www.albatria

DESCRIPTION:Paul Gravett is a London-based freelance journalist\, curator\
 , lecturer\, writer\, and broadcaster\, who has worked in comics publishin
 g and promotion since 1981.\n\nIn the early 1980s he manned the Fast Ficti
 on table at the bi-monthly Saturday comic marts held in London's Westminst
 er Hall\, inviting anybody to sell their homemade comics from it\, with al
 l proceeds going to the creator. This role earned him the nickname 'Man At
  The Crossroads' from Eddie Campbell in his graphic novel Alec: How To Be 
 An Artist\, "He will be the purest\, most fresh-faced wee fellow you have 
 ever met. His ingenuous enthusiasm will beam from his cheery countenance."
 \n\nIn 1983 he launched Escape Magazine\, which he co-edited/published wit
 h Peter Stanbury\, showcasing the cream of the alternative cartoonists of 
 the 1980s. Escape lasted for 19 issues before closing its doors in 1989. F
 or six years\, Escape helped to promote an evolving bunch of distinctive B
 ritish creators\, many of whom were quickly picked up by other comics publ
 ishers and by the UK music press\, newspapers\, magazines and galleries. T
 he Comics Journal in #210 said of Escape\, "This now-defunct London based 
 anthology remains one of the most sorely missed comics of all time not sim
 ply because of its tremendous track record of translating European comics 
 but simply because it was always good in so many ways."\n\nUnder the Escap
 e Publishing imprint\, he co-published Violent Cases in 1987\, the first c
 ollaboration between Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean\, three volumes of Eddie 
 Campbell's Alec between 1984 and 1986\, and London's Dark in 1988 by James
  Robinson and Paul Johnson.\n\nBetween 1992 and 2001 he was the director o
 f The Cartoon Art Trust\, a UK charity established in 1988\, dedicated to 
 preserving and promoting the best of British cartoon art and caricature an

 ce library.\n\nHe has curated numerous exhibitions of comic art in Britain
  and in Europe\, including 'God Save The Comics!'\, a survey of British co
 mic art at the National Comics and Image Centre in Angoulême\, France and
  the first exhibit devoted to the writer Alan Moore and his collaborators 
 at the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Charleroi\, Belgium. As Project Director o
 f The Cartoon Art Trust in London\, he worked on tributes to Carl Giles an
 d Charles Schulz\, creator of Peanuts\, and The 100 British Cartoonists of
  the Century. His subsequent exhibitions have included retrospectives of J
 ack Kirby at the Fumetto Festival in Lucerne\, and of Tove Jansson and Pos
 y Simmonds at the Belgian Comics Art Museum in Brussels.\n\nSince 2003\, P
 aul has been the director of Comica\, the London International Comics Fest
 ival\, initially at the Institute of Contemporary Arts. From 2011 to 2017\
 , Comica became an independent not-for-profit organisation running both th
 e annual festival and other events and exhibitions throughout the year. Cu
 rrently\, Comica continues to run the monthly meet-up\, Comica Social Club
 \, and the annual Graphic Short Story Prize and finalists’ exhibition in
  association with The Observer and Jonathan Cape Graphic Novels.\n\nPaul i

 mentary The Mindscape Of Alan Moore (2007). He is regularly interviewed ab
 out British and international comics for the BBC\, Sky News\, Channel 4 Ne
 ws\, France Culture\, TRT World and others.\n\nHe continues to write about

 \nThe big challenge in selling innovation to healthcare is the misalignmen
 t \nof payment incentives exacerbated by a period of transition from \nfee
 -for-service to value-based care. Design a system to deliver better \npati
 ent care at a lower cost – you may have just reduced hospital revenue. \
 nTarget the insurers who realize the savings – they cannot always influe
 nce \ncare delivery.\nAll of this is complicated by the time required to p
 rove innovation in this \nmarket – the clinician who values the innovati
 on is not the financial \ndecision maker who can approve adoption. The CFO
  wants evidence of savings \n– from proposal to white paper can be a 3-4
  year cycle. Many healthcare \ninnovators burn through their funding befor
 e the puzzle is solved.
