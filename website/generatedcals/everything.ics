DESCRIPTION:Because of the turnout of last week\, we'll be running two ind
 ividual one-shots this week!THE RAID ON DRAGON'S SHEATHE Run by GordonHey 
 you! Yeah you! Do you want to raid a dragon's hoard and get a lot of gold?
  Are you OK with not asking questions? If yes\, then I have the perfect ad
 venture for you that definitely has 0 twists in it. This is a D&D adventur
 e for 3rd level characters and is perfect for new players or players still
  learning the system. I will have pre-made character sheets or you can mak
 e your own.THE CITY OF CONTAMINATED HEROESRun by KevinTonight\, the world 
 ends. The diviners have looked to the stars\, but there is no tomorrow. Ho
 wever\, that isn't to say that it's too late for us yet. The diviners have
  told us where the origin of apocalypse is\, and there we will send our le
 gendary heroes.This is a D&D adventure/boss rush for up to 7 16th level ch
 aracters and is aimed more towards experienced players familiar with high-
 level gameplay. I will have pre-made character sheets or you can make your
  own with pre-approval.\nHosted by: CMU RPG Association\nAdditional Inform

 ts may study abroad for a semester\, academic year or during the summer in
  various countries around the world\, including Carnegie Mellon’s campus
  in Doha\, Qatar. A well-planned study abroad program will allow a student
  to receive credit for study abroad coursework and graduate on time. Many 
 students are able to use their Carnegie Mellon funding for these study abr

 -inspired robotics\n\n\nASA Conference Room 6115\n\n\nGates Hillman Center
 s\n\n\nProfessor\n\nAbstract: \n\n\n\nThe ability to manufacture micro-sc
 ale sensors and actuators has inspired the robotics community for over 30 
 years. There have been huge success stories\; MEMS inertial sensors have e
 nabled an entire market of low-cost\, small UAVs. However\, the promise of
  ant-scale robots has largely failed. Ants can move high speeds on surface
 s from picnic tables to front lawns\, but the few legged microrobots that 
 have walked have done so at slow speeds (< 1 body length/sec) on smooth si
 licon wafers. In addition\, the vision of large numbers of microfabricated
  sensors interacting directly with the environment has suffered in part du
 e to the brittle materials used in micro-fabrication. This talk will prese
 nt our progress in the design of sensors\, mechanisms\, and actuators that
  utilize new microfabrication processes to incorporate materials with wide
 ly varying moduli and functionality to achieve more robustness\, dynamic r
 ange\, and complexity in smaller packages. Results include skins of soft t
 actile or strain sensors with high dynamic range\, new models of bio-inspi
 red jumping mechanisms\, and magnetically actuated legged microrobots from
  1 gram down to 1 milligram that provide insights into simple design and c
 ontrol for high speed locomotion in small-scale mobile robots.\n\n\n\n—\
 n\n\n\nSarah Bergbreiter joined the Department of Mechanical Engineering a
 t Carnegie Mellon University in the fall of 2018 after ten years at the Un
 iversity of Maryland\, College Park. She received her B.S.E. degree in ele
 ctrical engineering from Princeton University in 1999. After a short intro
 duction to the challenges of sensor networks at a small startup company\, 
 she received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of California\
 , Berkeley in 2004 and 2007 with a focus on microrobotics. Prof. Bergbreit
 er received the DARPA Young Faculty Award in 2008\, the NSF CAREER Award i
 n 2011\, and the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engine

  down to sub-millimeter size scales. She has received several Best Paper a

 cations\n\n\nASA Conference Room 6115\n\n\nGates Hillman Centers\n\n\nMana
 ger\, Robotics Climbers & Grippers Group\n\nAbstract: \n\n\n\nThe previou
 s generation of NASA missions to the outer solar system discovered salt wa
 ter oceans on Europa and Enceladus\, each with more liquid water than Eart
 h – compelling targets to look for extraterrestrial life. Closer to home
 \, JAXA and NASA have imaged sky-light entrances to lava tube caves on the
  Moon more than 100 m in diameter and ESA has characterized the incredibly
  varied and complex terrain of Comet 67P. While JPL has successfully lande
 d and operated four rovers on the surface of Mars using a 6-wheeled rocker
 -bogie architecture\, future missions will require new mobility architectu
 res for these extreme environments. Unfortunately\, the highest value scie
 nce targets often lie in the terrain that is hardest to access. This talk 
 will explore robotic grippers that enable missions to these extreme terrai
 ns through their ability to grip a wide variety of surfaces (shapes\, size
 s\, and geotechnical properties). To prepare for use in space where repair
  or replacement is not possible\, we field-test these grippers and robots 
 in analog extreme terrain on Earth. Many of these systems are enabled by a
 dvances in autonomy. The talk will present a rapid overview of my work and
  a detailed case study of an underactuated rock gripper for deflecting ast
 eroids.\n\n\n\n—\n\n\n\nDr. Aaron Parness was the Group Supervisor of th
 e Robotic Grippers and Climbing Robots Group at JPL and the head of the Ro
 botic Rapid Prototyping Laboratory. He received two bachelor’s degrees f
 rom MIT (Mechanical Engineering & Creative Writing)\, and his MS and PhD f
 rom Stanford University. He has led Moon Diver\, a proposed Discovery-clas
 s mission that would send a rappelling robot into a lunar cave\, and sever
 al R&D tasks featuring robotic grippers. His research over the last decade
  has emphasized iterative design\, rapid and novel manufacturing methods\,
  and field testing. He has led the development of grippers fielded on volc
 anic terrain in Hawaii’s Volcanoes National Park\, within ice caves on M
 t. Rainier and Mt. St Helens\, and at 2\,000 m depth in the Pacific Ocean.
  He also developed a gecko-inspired adhesive and robotic grippers that fle
 w to the International Space Station\, were featured as a Popular Science 
 Top 100 innovation of the year\, and have been licensed to a startup compa
 ny selling gecko grippers for pick and place applications in the manufactu
 ring space.\n\n\n\nFaculty Host: David Wettergreen\n\n\nhttps://www.ri.cmu

 uage is Hard: How hard? What does it mean for future applications and hard
 ware?\n\n\n1107\n\n\nHamerschlag Hall\n\n\nResearch Scientist\n\nAbstract:
  \n\n\n\nLanguage applications are emerging as the next major frontier of
  deep learning\, but they require large systems to train state-of-the-art 
 models. Why? I’ll describe my (Baidu’s) prior large-scale empirical st
 udies [1]: As training set size increases\, DL model generalization error 
 and model sizes scale as particular power-law relationships (not entirely 
 consistent with theoretical results). As model size grows\, training time 
 remains roughly constant—larger models require fewer steps to converge t
 o the same accuracy. Given these scaling relationships\, we can accurately
  predict the expected accuracy and training time for models trained on lar
 ger data sets [2]. Language applications\, in particular\, are hard to sca
 le and will require upward of 100x more compute than we currently use.\n\n
 \n\nWhy are language applications so hard? Language is often a minimum des
 cription of structures/concepts\, and these descriptions are usually conte
 xt-sensitive! Current state-of-the-art models find “low-dimensional” r
 elationships between words or concepts and compose them together\, requiri
 ng deep hierarchy. Emerging applications require significantly longer pred
 iction lengths\, encouraging models that don’t just predict but also sim
 ulate.\n\n\n\n[1] Hestness et al.\, Deep Learning Scaling is Predictable\,

 llman Centers\n\n\nPostdoctoral Researcher\n\nAbstract: \n\n\n\nA long-st
 anding puzzle in quantum complexity theory is to understand the power of t
 he class MIP* of multiprover interactive proofs with shared entanglement. 
 This question is closely related to the study of entanglement through non-
 local games\, which dates back to the pioneering work of Bell. In this wor
 k we show that MIP* contains NEEXP (non-deterministic doubly-exponential t
 ime)\, exponentially improving the prior lower bound of NEXP due to Ito an
 d Vidick. Our result shows that shared entanglement exponentially increase
 s the power of these proof systems\, as the class MIP of multiprover inter
 active proofs without shared entanglement is known to be equal to NEXP.\n\

 \n\nTraffic21 Classroom 6501\n\n\nGates Hillman Centers\n\n\nPh.D. Student
 \n\nAbstract: \n\n\n\nDependent type theories are a family of logical sys
 tems that serve as expressive functional programming languages and as the 
 basis of many proof assistants. In the past decade\, type theories have al
 so attracted the attention of mathematicians due to surprising connections
  with homotopy theory\; the study of these connections\, known as homotopy
  type theory\, has in turn suggested novel extensions to type theory\, inc
 luding higher inductive types and Voevodsky's univalence axiom. However\, 
 in their original axiomatic presentation\, these extensions lack computati
 onal content\, making them unusable as programming constructs and unergono
 mic in proof assistants.\n\n\n\nIn this dissertation\, we present Cartesia
 n cubical type theory\, a univalent type theory that extends ordinary type
  theory with interval variables representing abstract hypercubes. We justi
 fy Cartesian cubical type theory by means of a computational semantics tha
 t generalizes Allen's semantics of Nuprl to Cartesian cubical sets. Proofs
  in our type theory have computational content\, as evidenced by the canon
 icity property that all closed terms of Boolean type evaluate to true or f
 alse. It is the second univalent type theory with canonicity\, after the D
 e Morgan cubical type theory of Cohen et al. (2018)\, and affirmatively re
 solves an open question of whether Cartesian interval structure constructi
 vely models univalent universes.\n\n\n\nThesis Committee:\n	Robert Harper

 : \n\nResource-Constrained State Estimation with Multi-Modal Sensing\n\n\
 nReddy Conference Room 4405\n\n\nGates Hillman Centers\n\n\nPh.D. Student\
 n\nAbstract: \n\n\n\nAccurate and reliable state estimation is essential 
 for safe mobile robot operation in real-world environments because ego-mot
 ion estimates are required by many critical autonomy functions such as con
 trol\, planning\, and mapping. Computing accurate state estimates depends 
 on the physical characteristics of the environment\, the selection of suit
 able sensors to capture that information\, and the availability of compute
  to perform inference on sensor observations. Because environment characte
 ristics cannot be controlled in typical field operation scenarios\, carefu
 l sensor selection and efficient fusion algorithms are required to achieve
  accurate\, high-rate state estimation on mobile robots.\n	 \n	Visual-ine
 rtial odometry is well-suited to onboard state estimation in environments 
 that have rich visual texture. As with other vision-based methods\, it per
 forms poorly when operating on images with non-ideal characteristics such 
 as low visual texture\, dynamic objects\, or far away scenes. Common metho
 ds to mitigate these problems include introducing visual observations from
  different fields of view and using depth observations. However\, processi
 ng additional sources and types of observations requires more computation\
 , which is extremely limited on size\, weight\, and power constrained robo
 ts such as micro aerial vehicles. Therefore\, there is a need to reduce th
 e computational burden associated with using more observations to increase
  accuracy through efficient selection of useful observations from multiple
  heterogeneous sensors.\n	 \n	In this thesis\, we propose an optimization
 -based state estimator that fuses observations from multiple heterogeneous
  sensors to achieve reliable performance in scenarios that are challenging
  for typical minimal sensing configurations. The work completed thus far d
 emonstrates a baseline monocular sparse visual-inertial odometry algorithm
  using fixed-lag smoothing augmented with improvements in covariance estim
 ation and initialization from rest. This baseline state estimator has been
  fully implemented onboard an aerial robot and used for closed-loop contro
 l in a number of different indoor and outdoor environments. The proposed w
 ork aims to improve state estimation performance in non-ideal sensing cond
 itions by (1) extending the visual-inertial odometry framework to support 
 multiple asynchronous cameras with disjoint fields of view\, (2) leveragin
 g depth observations to boost performance in visually degraded environment
 s\, and (3) developing methods to allocate limited computational resources
  to process exteroceptive observations that are more informative for estim
 ation. The proposed methods will be evaluated onboard an aerial robot in v
 isually challenging environments.\n\n\n\n\n	Thesis Committee:\n	Nathan Mic

 Simon Hall \n\n\nPh.D. Student\n\nAbstract: \n\n\n\nA wealth of security 
 guidance is available to users and security system designers. Much of this
  guidance assumes an idealized world in which users are motivated and atte
 ntive when completing security tasks interjected in front of their primary
  task\; and in which system designers are free to design security systems 
 that subject their user base to however poor a usability experience deemed
  necessary in order to maximize security benefits for those users. However
 \, these idealized-world assumptions do not reflect reality. Users perform
  security as a secondary task\, typically unmotivated to exert more than t
 he minimum possible effort to accomplish security tasks\, which they ultim
 ately perform in an inattentive\, error-prone manner.\n\n\n\nI will demons
 trate how practical guidance can be given to users that assumes real-world
  settings but that does not abandon the worthwhile goal of improving secur
 ity for those who do not want to or cannot take the security-optimal appro
 ach. First\, I will show how users can be guided to create strong password
 s while minimizing negative usability impacts\, using password policies th
 at incorporate a minimum neural-network-derived password-strength requirem
 ent. Second\, I will show how latent features of passwords can be learned 
 that can then be leveraged to improve password-creation guidance with more
  relevant and comprehensive text feedback. Lastly\, I will show how practi
 cal guidance can be given to system designers in authentication domains ot
 her than passwords\, using public-key verification as a case study. Specif
 ically\, I will examine ways of exposing fingerprint verification to ordin
 ary users that remain effective at protecting against man-in-the-middle at
 tacks in low-risk situations or usability-focused environments.\n\n\n\nThe

 n\n\nTraffic21 Classroom 6501\n\n\nGates Hillman Centers\n\n\nPh.D. Studen
 t\n\nAbstract: \n\n\n\nWe show that Gallagers ensemble of Low-Density Par
 ity Check (LDPC) codes achieve list- decoding capacity. These are the firs
 t graph-based codes shown to have this property. Previously\, the only cod
 es known to achieve list-decoding capacity were completely random codes\, 
 random linear codes\, and codes constructed by algebraic (rather than comb
 inatorial) techniques. This result opens up a potential avenue towards tru
 ly linear-time list-decodable codes which achieve list-decoding capacity.\
 n\n\n\nOur result on list decoding follows from a much more general result
 : any local property satisfied with high probability by a random linear co
 de is also satisfied with high probability by a random LDPC code from Gall
 agers distribution. Local properties are properties characterized by the e
 xclusion of small sets of codewords\, and include list-decoding\, list-rec
 overy and average-radius listdecoding. Along the way\, we give a character
 ization of sets of codewords that are likely to appear in a random linear 
 code\, which may be of independent interest.\n\n\n\nJoint work with Jonath
 an Mosheiff\, Noga Ron-Zewi\, Shashwat Silas\, and Mary Wootters.\n\n\n\nP

 \n\n\n8102\n\n\nGates Hillman Centers\n\n\nPh.D. Student\n\nAbstract: \n\
 n\n\nThe polarized SILL programming language uniformly integrates function
 al programming and session-based concurrency. It supports recursion\, asyn
 chronous and synchronous communication\, and higher-order programs that co
 mmunicate processes. In this talk\, I will motivate and present a denotati
 onal semantics for a fragment of polarized SILL. I will explain why domain
  theory is an ideal setting for this semantics. Session types will be inte
 rpreted as domains of bidirectional communications. We use polarity and do
 main theory to split these into pairs of unidirectional communications in 
 a natural way. Processes will be interpreted as continuous functions on do
 mains of unidirectional communications.\n	\n	Presented in Partial Fulfillm

 e Strengths of Human and AI Instruction\n\n\nASA Conference Room 6115\n\n\
 nGates Hillman Centers\n\n\nPh.D. Student\n\nAbstract: \n\n\n\nWhen used 
 in K-12 classrooms\, AI-based educational software such as intelligent tut
 oring systems (ITSs) allows students to work at their own pace\, while als
 o freeing up the teacher to spend more time working one-on-one with studen
 ts. A common intuition is that\, in many situations\, human teachers may b
 e better suited to support students than ITSs alone (e.g.\, by providing s
 ocio-emotional support\, supporting student motivation\, or flexibly provi
 ding conceptual support when further problem-solving practice may be ineff
 ective). Yet ITSs are not typically designed to work together with teacher
 s during a class session\, to take advantage of these complementary streng
 ths. \n\n\n\nThis dissertation explores how AI tutors might be better des
 igned to work together with human teachers in real-time\, to amplify teach
 ers’ abilities to help their students. Working together with 36 middle s
 chool math teachers\, I conducted the first broad exploration in the liter
 ature of teachers’ needs for real-time analytics and orchestration suppo
 rt in AI-supported\, personalized classrooms. As part of this work\, I wor
 ked with teachers to design a form of real-time\, wearable teacher augment
 ation called Lumilo. \n\n\n\nLumilo is a set of mixed-reality smart glass
 es that direct teachers’ attention during a class session\, towards situ
 ations the tutoring software may be ill-suited to handle on its own\, and 
 support teachers in deciding how best to respond. Lumilo has been used by 
 teachers and students in over 40 middle school classrooms so far. An in-vi
 vo classroom experiment showed that teacher–AI co-orchestration\, as sup
 ported by Lumilo\, enhanced students’ learning compared with an AI-suppo
 rted classroom in which the teacher did not have such support. \n\n\n\nOv
 er the course of this research\, I have also developed new design and prot
 otyping methods to address challenges in the co-design\, experience protot
 yping\, and evaluation of data-driven AI systems. To support the use of th
 ese methods within the area of education\, my collaborators and I have ext
 ended an existing technical architecture (CTAT/TutorShop) to facilitate ra
 pid prototyping of data-driven educational AI applications.\n\n\n\nIn the 
 final chapters of this dissertation\, I explore how the concepts embodied 
 by Lumilo might be prepared for wider use\, from two angles. First\, I inv
 olve students\, as well as teachers\, in the next phase of design to bette
 r serve the needs and respect the boundaries of both stakeholder groups. S
 econd\, through a newly-formed academic–industry partnership with Carneg
 ie Learning (a major educational AI company) I begin to explore how real-t
 ime\, wearable teacher augmentation might be generalized to work with a br
 oader range of AI tutoring systems and curricula.\n\n\n\nThesis Committee:

 ior Research Scientist\n\nAbstract: \n\n\n\nDeep learning has rapidly mov
 ed from research to be a key component in providing industrial impact in a
 reas such as autonomous driving. From initial semantic segmentation to mor
 e recent advanced systems\, these algorithms continuously increase the con
 sumption of data and computational resources. The amount of data being acq
 uired\, and the need of annotations keep growing exponentially\; this open
 s up new challenges to improve accuracy and to achieve the desired safety 
 level. In this talk\, I will explore some of these challenges along with o
 ur proposed solutions in terms of active learning and computational effici
 ency for training and deploying deep networks at scale.\n\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n
 José M. Álvarez is a Senior Research Scientist at NVIDIA leading the res
 earch efforts in the AI-Infra team. The focus of the team is to scale-up d
 eep learning for Autonomous driving. Previously\, he was a senior research
  scientist at Toyota Research Institute and a senior scientist at Data61/C
 SIRO (formerly NICTA)\, Australia\, working on deep learning for large sca
 le dynamic scene understanding. Jose M. Alvarez graduated with his Ph.D. i
 n October 2010\, with a focus on robust road detection under real-world dr
 iving conditions. Dr. Alvarez did research stays at the University of Amst
 erdam (in 2008 and 2009) and the Electronics Research Group at Volkswagen 
 (in 2010) and Boston College. Subsequently\, he worked as a postdoctoral r
 esearcher at New York University under the supervision of Prof. Yann LeCun
 . Since 2014\, he serves as an associate editor for IEEE Transactions on I
 ntelligent Transportation Systems.\n\n\n\nRSVP Requested\n\n\n\nWe will be

 20 - 12:00pm\n\nTalk Title: \n\nRolling non-stop since 1995!\n\n\nMobot S
 lolom Race Course\n\n\nIn front of Wean Hall\n\nAbstract: \n\n\n\nThe Sch
 ool of Computer Science invites all members of the Carnegie Mellon communi
 ty to participate in The 26th Annual Carnegie Mellon Mobot Races. Particip
 ants will race autonomous vehicles ('MObile roBOTs') they have built along
  a slalom-type course on the paved walk in front of Wean Hall.\n\n\n\nThe 
 purpose of the competition is simple\, to generate technological excitemen
 t\, provide hands-on experience for our undergraduates\, and showcase the 
 cleverness and technical competence of Carnegie Mellon undergraduates and 
 other community members (including alumni!). We hope to stimulate inter-di
 sciplinary activity toward producing something that is technically notewor
 thy while having a great time.\n\n\n\nAll potential participants or those 
 just considering entering the races are welcome to try their hand. Individ
 uals and team efforts are particularly encouraged.  If you can't build on
 e yourself\, lean on a colleague\, friend\, or associate in another divisi
 on.  There is strength (and sometimes better Mobots!) through collaborati
 on and sharing of skills/knowledge.  You know you want to try it\, so don
 't shy away!\n\n\n\nAnd if you don't build one\, come cheer on a friend...
 \n\n\n\nAnd alums - come on\, we know you can still build a Mobot\, right?
   We hope to see you at and 'in' the races!  And we're giving you 2 term
 s to work on it :)\n\n\n\n \n\n\nhttp://www.cs.cmu.edu/mobot\n\nFor More

 k is a computer scientist and self-professed evangelist for computing. She
  is the recipient of numerous awards including being appointed Officer of 
 the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for her services to technology in 20
 16\, and from the USA she received the Anita Borg Social Impact Abie Award
  for making a positive impact on women\, technology\, and society. In 2011
 \, Black won the PepsiCo Women's Inspiration Award. In 2009\, Black was pr
 esented the first John Ivinson Award  from the British Computer Society a
 t the Royal Society in London.\n\n\n\nDr. Black is a leader for gender par
 ity in computing in the United Kingdom. Among her many efforts she started
  #techmums\, a program that offers mothers free training workshops in digi
 tal security\, social media\, and programming with the aim of building con
 fidence and expanding opportunities for women with litle exposure to compu
 ting. She is also founder of the British Computer Society’s Specialist G
 roup BCSWomen.\n\n\n\nDr. Black is perhaps most well-known for initiating 
 -- and succeeding -- in Saving Bletchley Park\, the site of world war 11 c
 odebreaking. Her book\, and her work at Bletchlely Park included the oral 
 history project conducted to capture the memories of the women who worked 
 there. She is the subject of numerous radio and television shows\, press a
 rticles\, and YouTube videos. Dr. Black tempers her optimism for the futur
 e of women in computing but notes “if we don’t have women involved\, i
 f we don’t have diversity at the heart of what we’re doing\, I think w
 e’re creating a world which is not a world that I want to see.”\n\nFor

 lways played a central role in neuroscientific experimentation and theoriz
 ing. Historically\, Nissl and Golgi staining methods were crucial to allow
 ing researchers to produce data bearing on the neuron doctrine. More recen
 tly\, the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (B
 RAIN) initiative\, launched by former President Barack Obama and carried o
 ut with support from the NIH\, NSF\, DARPA\, and IARPA\, has directed reso
 urces into the development of new technologies in the hope that it will im
 prove\, or even revolutionize\, our understanding of the brain. Additional
 ly\, new computational technologies potentially give insight into understa
 nding how to link behaviour to neuroscience in ways that many hope will im
 pact clinical practice.<br /> <br />The aim of this workshop is to explor
 e how tools and technology have advanced neuroscience and cognitive scienc
 e and consider their epistemological and broader philosophical implication
 s. We are inviting abstract submissions linked to the workshop’s main qu
 estions:<br />1)    How are new technologies in neuroscience assessed an
 d revised?<br />2)    How have new technologies in neuroscience advanced
  debates in (philosophy of) cognitive science?<br /><br />We welcome any a
 bstracts related to the overall theme of the workshop on tools and technol
 ogy in neuroscience though preference may be given to those that directly 
 address the main questions. In delimiting what counts as technology\, we i
 nclude both instruments and devices that can be portable to different expe
 rimental contexts\, but also techniques\, protocols and modelling tools. E
 xamples could include (but are not limited to): CLARITY\, Scale\, SeeDB\, 
 fMRI\, Deep Brain Stimulation\, text/data mining methods\, connectomics\, 
 MVPA\, machine learning\, Brain-computer interfaces\, DREADDs\, optogeneti
 cs and TMS. We hope this workshop encourages a substantive dialogue betwee
 n researchers in neuroscience/cognitive science and philosophy. To facilit
 ate this\, each contributed talk will be paired with a commentator who is 
 a senior faculty member in philosophy/neuroscience as appropriate.</span><

 One example is Hilbert’s 13th Problem\, which concerns formulas for the 
 roots of a polynomial in terms of its coefficients. Work on this problem r

 athematics. In this talk I will explain part of the circle of ideas surrou
 nding this problem\, including the inspirational viewpoints of Felix Klein
  and Henri Poincaré. Along the way we will see some beautiful mathematica
 l objects: algebraic functions\, braids\, the 27 lines on a smooth cubic s
 urface\, and more\; all intimately related to each other\, all with myster
 ies still to reveal.</p>\n<p>Much of this talk should be understandable to

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: Anomalous Velocity and Geometry in Wave Mechanics</p
 >\n<p>Abstract: In electronic band theory the dynamics of electrons in cry
 stal lattices can exhibit novel phenomena associated with the anomalous ve
 locity<strong>.   </strong>Modern work on this subject revives an idea w
 hich appeared in its primitive form some fifty years ago to interpret the 
 anomalous Hall effect in magnetically ordered states of matter\, namely th
 e appearance of a Hall conductivity in materials that have spontaneously b
 roken time reversal symmetry without an applied magnetic field. The signat
 ure of the anomalous velocity is the coupling of electron motion to applie
 d static and time-dependent fields through a family of transverse response
  functions with driving terms that are geometrical in origin.  This idea 
 has been brought to the forefront by a modern focus on the topological nat
 ure of degenerate points and lines in the band structures of crystals and 
 their observable consequences in electron dynamics.  Remarkably in this c
 ontext the concept of anomalous velocity reappears with some unexpected  
 consequences for both  gapped “topological” states of matter and for 
 special gapless topological semimetallic states. This talk will present a 
 brief overview of these ideas and illustrate them with examples drawn from
  work on two dimensional electronic systems.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Speaker: Kevin Zumbrun (Indiana University)</p>\n<p>Title: 
 Stability of roll wave solutions in inclined shallow-water flow </p>\n<p>
 Abstract: We review recent developments in stability of periodic roll-wave
  solutions of the Saint Venant equations for inclined shallow-water flow. 
 Such waves are well-known instances of hydrodynamic instability\, playing 
 an important role in hydraulic engineering\, for example\, flow in a chann
 el or dam spillway. Until recently\, the analysis of their stability has b
 een mainly by formal analysis in the weakly unstable or ``near-onset'' reg
 ime. However\, hydraulic engineering applications are mainly in the strong
 ly unstable regime far from onset. We discuss here a unified framework dev
 eloped together with Blake Barker\, Mat Johnson\, Pascal Noble\, Miguel Ro
 drigues\, and Zhao Yang for the study of roll wave stability across all pa
 rameter regimes\, by a combination of rigorous analysis and numerical comp
 utation. The culmination of our analysis is a complete stability diagram\,
  of which the low-frequency stability boundary is\, remarkably\, given exp
 licitly as the solution of a a cubic equation in the parameters of the sol
 ution space. </p>

  separate results\, one for a system of magnetic Fe impurities in a chromi

 ture\, low-temperature\, and spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy.
  A case can be made for a Kondo resonance in the Fe/CrN system and a local
  strain-dependent shift of electronic states in the 2D-MnGaN. The local st
 rain is also found to affect the in-plane versus out-of-plane magnetic ani
 sotropy.</p>\n<p>Theoretical first-principles calculations supplement the

 /strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The famous Szemerédi–T
 rotter theorem states that any arrangement of \\(n\\) points and \\(n\\) l
 ines in the plane determines \\(O(n^{4/3})\\) incidences\, and this bound 
 is tight. Although there are several proofs for the Szemerédi–Trotter t
 heorem\, our knowledge of the structure of the point-line arrangements max
 imizing the number of incidences is severely lacking. In this talk\, we pr
 esent some Turán-type results for point-line incidences. Let \\(\\mathcal
 {L}_1\\) and \\(\\mathcal{L}_2\\) be two sets of \\(t\\) lines in the plan
 e and let \\(P=\\{\\ell_1 \\cap \\ell_2 : \\ell_1 \\in \\mathcal{L}_1\, \\
 ell_2 \\in \\mathcal{L}_2\\}\\) be the set of intersection points between 
 \\(\\mathcal{L}_1\\) and \\(\\mathcal{L}_2\\). We say that \\((P\, \\mathc
 al{L}_1 \\cup \\mathcal{L}_2)\\) forms a <em>natural \\(t\\times t\\) grid
 </em> if \\(|P| =t^2\\)\, and \\(\\mathrm{conv}(P)\\) does not contain the
  intersection point of some two lines in \\(\\mathcal{L}_i\\)\, for \\(i =
  1\,2\\). For fixed \\(t > 1\\)\, we show that any arrangement of \\(n\\) 
 points and \\(n\\) lines in the plane that does not contain a natural \\(t
 \\times t\\) grid determines \\(O(n^{\\frac{4}{3}- \\varepsilon})\\) incid
 ences\, where \\(\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon(t)\\). We also provide a cons
 truction of \\(n\\) points and \\(n\\) lines in the plane that does not co
 ntain a natural \\(2 \\times 2\\) grid and determines at least \\(\\Omega(
 {n^{1+\\frac{1}{14}}})\\) incidences. This is joint work with Andrew Suk.<

  model appears to lose two derivatives through the pressure-displacement r
 elation which links pressure to the tangential slip.  By discovering a di
 spersive cancelation at the top of the lower deck\, we prove the local wel

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: Ideal Hyperbolic Polyhedra and Discrete Uniformizati
 on</p>\n<p>Abstract: We provide a constructive\, variational proof of Rivi
 n’s realization<br />theorem for ideal hyperbolic polyhedra with prescri
 bed intrinsic<br />metric\, which is equivalent to a discrete uniformizati
 on theorem for<br />spheres. The same variational method is also used to p
 rove a discrete<br />uniformization theorem of Gu et al. and a correspondi
 ng polyhedral<br />realization result of Fillastre. The variational princi
 ples involve<br />twice continuously differentiable functions on the decor
 ated<br />Teichmüller spaces of punctured surfaces\, which are analytic i
 n each<br />Penner cell\, convex on each fiber and invariant under the act
 ion of<br />the mapping class group. Although this abstract contains some 
 big<br />words\, considerable parts of the talk will be fairly elementary.

 \n<p><em><strong>Integer points in irrational polyhedra and an extension o
 f Presburger Arithmetic</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> W
 e consider polyhedra with coordinates lying in a real algebraic number fie
 ld <em>F</em>. The structure of integer points in such algebraic polyhedra
  is much less well understood compared to the rational case. We formalize 
 by extending the classical Presburger Arithmetic to a theory <em>S</em>\, 
 which allows algebraic scalar multiplication besides additions of integers
 . A dichotomy is established: the theory <em>S</em> is decidable if and on
 ly if <em>K</em> is a quadratic field. Geometrically\, this means the stru
 cture of integer points in algebraic polyhedra becomes intractable under c
 oordinate projections and Boolean operations. Our method combines several 
 ideas from computability theory and elementary number theory. Ostrowski re
 presentation of real numbers play a crucial role.</p>\n<p>Joint work with 
 Philipp Hieronymi and Igor Pak.</p>\n<p>Before the talk\, at 3:10 pm\, the
 re will be tea and cookies in Wean Hall 6220.</p>

 >\n<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cells are bombarded by noise from both wi
 thin and outside the cells. The noise has been characterized by many studi
 es. But\, how the noise can be exploited in therapeutic treatment and disc
 overy remains elusive. In recent work\, my lab discovers that antibiotic-r
 esistant bacteria can exploit noise to survive treatment. The exploitation
  of noise\, also called stochastic resonance\, is a result of matching flu
 ctuation frequency of noise in gene expression and metabolism. The discove
 ry creates a new avenue for exploiting stochastic resonance in antibiotic 
 treatment. Along this line\, I will show how the noise can be manipulated 
 using a novel CRISPR-Cas-based method. In addition\, my lab is applying th
 e findings in cell-free systems and artificial cells to enable the high-th
 roughput study of membrane proteins\, proteoforms\, and exosomes. My lab i
 ntegrates computational and synthetic biology to create a new frontier in 
 the bottom-up engineering of cellular networks for biomedical application.

DESCRIPTION:<p>Title: Algebraic and Geometric constraints on 4d Superconfo
 rmal Field Theories</p>\n<p>Abstract: In this talk I will first present an
  overview of Superconformal Field Theories (SCFTs) focusing particularly o
 n the analysis of their moduli space of vacua of N=2 SCFTs. I will outline
  the intricate set of algebraic\, coming from intriguing relations with 2d
  non-unitary conformal theories\, and geometric constraints which makes a 
 classification scheme possible. I will conclude describing a recently disc
 overed new structures underling N=2 SCFTs which might enable a systematic 
 construction of all such theories with a minimal set of inputs.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p><em><strong>Optimal Investment with Correlated Stochastic V
 olatility Factors</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>The pro
 blem of portfolio allocation in the context of stocks evolving in random e
 nvironments\, that is with volatility and returns depending on random fact
 ors\, has attracted a lot of attention. The problem of maximizing a power 
 utility at a terminal time with only one random factor can be linearized t
 hanks to a classical distortion transformation. In the present paper\, we 
 address the problem with several factors using a perturbation technique ar
 ound the case where these factors are perfectly correlated reducing the pr
 oblem to the case with a single factor. We illustrate our result with a pa
 rticular model for which we have explicit formulas. A rigorous accuracy re
 sult is also derived using sub- and super-solutions of the HJB equation in
 volved. In order to keep the notations as explicit as possible\, we treat 
 the case with one stock and two factors and we describe an extension to th
 e case with two stocks and two factors.</p>

 set depends on its “liquidity” - the ease with which it can be traded.
  An equilibrium is achieved through a system of coupled forward-backward S
 DEs\, whose solution turns out to be amenable to an asymptotic analysis fo
 r the practically relevant regime of large liquidity. We also calibrate ou
 r model to time series data of market prices and trading volume\, and disc
 uss how to leverage deep-learning techniques to obtain numerical solutions

 A mutations can be detected in EVs isolated from plasma samples of cancer 
 patients. Alternatively\, nanomaterial-integrated microfluidic devices are
  designed for size-based EV isolation and on-chip sample preparation. Fina
 lly\, we have been investigating using EV membrane to camouflage nanoparti
 cle constructs for highly efficient systemic delivery of anticancer drugs.
  Collectively\, micro/nano engineering enables some exciting emerging canc
 er diagnostic and therapeutic approaches\, which is promising for new disc
 overy in cancer biology and translation into clinical practice.</p>\n<p><s

DESCRIPTION:<p><em><strong>High stresses occurring in fiber-reinforced com
 posites</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In fiber-reinforc
 ed composites\, high shear stress concentration often occurs in between ne
 ighboring stiff fibers. This has been suggested as a cause for unexpectedl
 y low strength. The shear stress is represented by the gradient of the sol
 ution to a conductivity equation with two neighboring inclusions which are
  the cross-sections of fibers. The closer two inclusions with extreme cond
 uctivity are to each other\, the arbitrarily larger the gradient becomes i
 n the narrow region between them. Much research has been successfully done
  to explain the blow-up of gradient and to estimate its magnitude. A speci
 al function has played a pivotal role in these studies. In this talk\, we 
 use the function to estimate the magnitude of the gradient\, to describe i
 ts distribution\, and also to verify various results that have been develo
 ped and generalized so far.</p>\n<p>Actually\, the special function is an 
 eigenfunction corresponding to the eigenvalue 1/2 of a Neumann–Poincare 
 type operator defined on the boundaries of the inclusions. Time permitting
 \, we will show that if there are N simply connected mutually disjoint inc
 lusions\, then the eigenvalue 1/2 has multiplicity N.</p>\n<p>This talk is
  based on the joint works with Habib Ammari (ETH Zurich)\, Giulio Ciraolo 
 (Università degli Studi di Palermo)\, Hyeonbae Kang (Inha Univ.)\, Hyunda
 e Lee (Inha Univ.) and Mikyoung Lim (KAIST).</p>

 g></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Mari Kawamura</strong> is a concert pianist 
 whose curiosity and wide-ranging interests have taken her in many directio
 ns. Her repertoire includes pieces by William Byrd\, late Scriabin\, Xenak
 is\, Cage and several contemporary Japanese composers. She has been collab
 orating with composers for many years and has premiered many works by youn
 g composers. She has appeared in the major festivals\, such as Tanglewood 
 Music Center\, Spoleto Festival USA and the Darmstadt International Summer
  Course and has given both solo and chamber music concerts in various venu
 es\, including Jordan Hall (Boston)\, Regent Hall (London) and Kirsten Kj
 ær Museum (Denmark). Her 2013 performance of Xenakis’s Dikthas at the S
 ICPP in Boston was described as “an unrelenting volcanic eruption” by 
 NEWMUSICBOX. Kawamura holds a Master’s degree from the Royal Academy of 
 Music\, where she achieved the DipRAM prize for her outstanding final reci
 tal. Her master’s thesis “Realization of Music for Piano 21-36” focu
 sed on “performers’ own discretion in Cage’s music\, which is indete
 rminate with respect to its performance.” Her teachers included Vadim Sa
 kharov\, Tatiana Sarkissova\, and Stephen Drury. Kawamura is now pursuing 
 her DMA degree under Aleck Karis at the University of California\, San Die
 go.</p>\n<p><strong>Joey Bourdeau</strong>: Imaginary Concerto (2018)<br /
 >Written for Mari Kawamura in 2018\, Imaginary Concerto is a work for pian
 o and electronics which takes the performer on a journey through a series 
 of surreal imagined landscapes\, and musical situations. Quoting extensive
 ly from various areas of the piano repertoire\, as well as from Francis Co
 uperin’s L’Art de Toucher le Clavecin\, the work takes a playful and p
 ersonality-driven look at the nature of virtuosity and performance in gene
 ral. Throughout the work\, the personalities of the composer\, performer\,
  and quoted materials often interact in surprising ways\, addressing in pa
 rticular the virtuosity of flexibility and range\, while creating a divers
 e and chaotic environment.</p>\n<p><strong>Anthony Vine</strong>: Soft Mar
 gins And Wide Peripheries (2018)<br />Soft Margins and Wide Peripheries co
 nsists of a number of modules—ranging from single held notes\, to multip
 le pages of events—built from an interconnected reservoir of piano harmo
 nics. The material is cast in a series of grids\, in which the spacing and
  proximity of events between and within these grids illuminates the subtle
 ties of the harmonic and timbral qualities of each string and harmonic. Th
 ese simple forms attempt to discourage a syntactical mode of listening\, i
 nviting one to take notice of peripheral facets of each harmonic sonority 
 (e.g. variance in articulation on a single harmonic\, how the decay of a n
 ote blooms or dissipates). The influence of Agnes Martin and Mei Mei Berse
 nbrugge loom largely in this piece.</p>\n<p><strong>Annie Hui-Hsin Hsieh</
 strong>: Chamber of Glistening Whispers (2018)<br />This piece portrays a 
 scenario of an intimate conversation between the pianist and the piano. Tr
 eated as a big resonating echo chamber\, the interior of the piano is tick
 led\, caressed\, soothed\, inspected and provoked by the various ways the 
 pianist is instructed to articulate the strings. Like a piece of foam soak
 ing in centuries of repertory memory\, the piano slowly and gradually awak
 ens to respond to the initiations of the pianist\, emerging from a passive
  state to become a sounding partner to the pianist. The audience is invite
 d to be the onlookers to this partnership\, being given a glimpse into thi
 s intricate and personal engagement.</p>

  November 19\, 2019\; Location TBD\, 4:45 p.m. to 5:45 p.m.\n\nWorld leade
 rs\, CEOs\, and academics have suggested that a revolution in artificial i
 ntelligence is upon us. If they are right\, what will advances in artifici
 al intelligence mean for international competition and the balance of powe
 r? How will it influence moral and ethical issues surrounding internationa
 l politics? This presentation discusses how developments in artificial int
 elligence (AI) — advanced\, narrow applications in particular — could 
 influence power and international politics. As a potentially general purpo
 se technology like electricity or the combustion engine\, AI could have wi
 de-ranging consequences for the world. This is particularly true given tha
 t the locus of innovation is coming from the private sector\, not the defe
 nse world. What will this mean for international politics and topics rangi
 ng from first mover advantages to ethics and war to the balance of power?\

 necessary for 'Pax Americana'? Peace as an independent variable"\n\nWednes
 day\, November 6\, 2019\; Location TBD\, 4:45 p.m. to 5:45 p.m.\n\nDespite
  some notable setbacks\, there has been a substantial increase worldwide i
 n economic development and political freedom since 1945\, and major war ha
 s been avoided. Credit for this is often given to policies and efforts by 
 the United States. However\, the positive developments would likely mostly
  have happened anyway.\n\nThe US did keep South Korea independent\, and it
  may also have helped stabilize Europe and Japan after 1945 (though most o
 f that was done by the locals). But the costly Cold War policy of deterren
 ce was not necessary\, and international Communism mostly collapsed becaus
 e of its own internal inadequacies\, not because of containment policy. Gr
 adual agreement that international trade should be more free and open was 
 not an American invention\, and the spread of democracy did not require mu
 ch participation by the US.\n\nFor the most part\, world order developed n
 ot from the machinations of the reigning superpower\, but from the peace
 —or aversion to international war—that was embraced especially by deve
 loped countries.\n\nMore information here: https://www.cmu.edu/ir/cirp-pol

  Countering Russian Social Media Influence"\n\nTuesday\, October 29\, 2019
 \; Location TBD\, 4:45 p.m. to 5:45 p.m.\n\nIn January 2017\, the US intel
 ligence community released a public report detailing a Russian influence c
 ampaign\, ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin\, to disrupt the US 
 presidential election. Part of a larger multifaceted approach\, this campa
 ign included social media-based disinformation spread by both automated bo
 ts and paid trolls. Russia's strategy was to push several conflicting narr
 atives simultaneously\, deepening existing divisions within American socie
 ty and degrading trust in Western institutions and the democratic process.
 \n\nWhile it is unknown what impact the campaign might have had on the 201
 6 presidential election\, or on individual opinions\, it is clear that Rus
 sia's efforts reached many Americans through a variety of social media pla
 tforms\, including Twitter and Facebook. The Russian "disinformation chain
 " that directs these campaigns starts from the very top — from Russian l
 eadership\, to Russian organs and proxies\, through amplification channels
  such as social media platforms\, and finally to US media consumers. This 
 presentation will categorize and analyze different approaches and policy o
 ptions to respond to the specific threat of Russian influence via disinfor
 mation spread on social media in the United States. Dr. Bodine-Baron will 
 also present a method to map and assess the information environment\, usin
 g a specific example of Russian propaganda in Eastern Europe.\n\nMore info

DESCRIPTION:Abstract: The ability to manufacture micro-scale sensors and a
 ctuators has inspired the robotics community for over 30 years. There have
  been huge success stories\; MEMS inertial sensors have enabled an entire 
 market of low-cost\, small UAVs. However\, the promise of ant-scale robots
  has largely failed. Ants can move high speeds on surfaces from picnic tab
 les to front lawns\, but the few legged microrobots that have walked have 
 done so at slow speeds (< 1 body length/sec) on smooth silicon wafers. In 
 addition\, the vision of large numbers of microfabricated sensors interact
 ing directly with the environment has suffered in part due to the brittle 
 materials used in micro-fabrication. This talk will present our progress i
 n the design of sensors\, mechanisms\, and actuators that utilize new micr
 ofabrication processes to incorporate materials with widely varying moduli
  and functionality to achieve more robustness\, dynamic range\, and comple
 xity in smaller packages. Results include skins of soft tactile or strain 
 sensors with high dynamic range\, new models of bio-inspired jumping mecha
 nisms\, and magnetically actuated legged microrobots from 1 gram down to 1
  milligram that provide insights into simple design and control for high s
 peed locomotion in small-scale mobile robots. \nBrief Bio: Sarah Bergbreit

DESCRIPTION:Abstract:\nHumans and robots would benefit from having rich se
 mantic maps of the terrain in which they operate.  Mobile robots equipped
  with sensors and perception software could build such maps as they naviga
 te through a new environment.  This information could then be used by hum
 ans or robots for better localization and path planning\, as well as a var
 iety of other tasks.  However\, it is hard to build good semantic maps wi
 thout a great deal of human effort and robot time.  Others have addressed
  this problem\, but they don’t provide a high level of semantic richness
 \, and in some cases their approaches require extensive human data labelin
 g and robot driving time. \nWe use a combination of better sensors and fea
 tures\, both proprioceptive and exteroceptive\, and self-supervised learni
 ng to solve this problem.  We enhance proprioception by exploring the use
  of new sensing modalities such as sound and vibration\, and in turn we in
 crease the number and variety of terrain types that can be estimated.  We
  build a supervised proprioceptive multiclass model that can predict up to
  seven terrain classes.  The proprioceptive predictions are then used as 
 labels to train a self-supervised exteroceptive model from camera data.  
 The exteroceptive model uses up-to-date vision learning techniques.  This
  exteroceptive model can then estimate those same terrain types more relia
 bly in new environments.  The exteroceptive semantic terrain predictions 
 can then be spatially registered into a larger map of the surrounding envi
 ronment.  3d point clouds from rolling/tilting ladar are used to register
  the proprioceptive and exteroceptive data\, as well as to register the re
 sulting exteroceptive predictions into the larger map.  Our claim is that
  self-supervised learning makes the exteroception more reliable since it c
 an be automatically retrained for new locations without human supervision.
   We conducted experiments to support this claim by collecting data sets 
 from different geographical environments and then comparing classification
  accuracies.  Our results show that our self-supervised learning approach
  is able to outperform supervised visual learning techniques. \nSpeaker Bi
 o:\nJacqueline Libby is a PhD candidate in the Robotics Institute.  Her r
 esearch interests are focused on developing real-world robotics systems. 
  At her time in the Robotics Institute\, she has worked with the best fiel
 d roboticists to explore how complex robotic systems can interact with the
  world in complex outdoor environments.  She hopes in the future to apply
  what she has learned in the arenas of environmental sustainability or med
 icine.  Her thesis work (as described in the abstract above) is focused o
 n sensor fusion techniques from a variety of sensing modalities as a way o
 f enhancing robot perception. \n

DESCRIPTION:Abstract:\nAccurate and reliable state estimation is essential
  for safe mobile robot operation in real-world environments because ego-mo
 tion estimates are required by many critical autonomy functions such as co
 ntrol\, planning\, and mapping. Computing accurate state estimates depends
  on the physical characteristics of the environment\, the selection of sui
 table sensors to capture that information\, and the availability of comput
 e to perform inference on sensor observations. Because environment charact
 eristics cannot be controlled in typical field operation scenarios\, caref
 ul sensor selection and efficient fusion algorithms are required to achiev
 e accurate\, high-rate state estimation on mobile robots. \nVisual-inertia
 l odometry is well-suited to onboard state estimation in environments that
  have rich visual texture. As with other vision-based methods\, it perform
 s poorly when operating on images with non-ideal characteristics such as l
 ow visual texture\, dynamic objects\, or far away scenes. Common methods t
 o mitigate these problems include introducing visual observations from dif
 ferent fields of view and using depth observations. However\, processing a
 dditional sources and types of observations requires more computation\, wh
 ich is extremely limited on size\, weight\, and power constrained robots s
 uch as micro aerial vehicles. Therefore\, there is a need to reduce the co
 mputational burden associated with using more observations to increase acc
 uracy through efficient selection of useful observations from multiple het
 erogeneous sensors. \nIn this thesis\, we propose an optimization-based st
 ate estimator that fuses observations from multiple heterogeneous sensors 
 to achieve reliable performance in scenarios that are challenging for typi
 cal minimal sensing configurations. The work completed thus far demonstrat
 es a baseline monocular sparse visual-inertial odometry algorithm using fi
 xed-lag smoothing augmented with improvements in covariance estimation and
  initialization from rest. This baseline state estimator has been fully im
 plemented onboard an aerial robot and used for closed-loop control in a nu
 mber of different indoor and outdoor environments. The proposed work aims 
 to improve state estimation performance in non-ideal sensing conditions by
  (1) extending the visual-inertial odometry framework to support multiple 
 asynchronous cameras with disjoint fields of view\, (2) leveraging depth o
 bservations to boost performance in visually degraded environments\, and (
 3) developing methods to allocate limited computational resources to proce
 ss exteroceptive observations that are more informative for estimation. Th
 e proposed methods will be evaluated onboard an aerial robot in visually c
 hallenging environments. \nMore Information \nThesis Committee Members:\nN

DESCRIPTION:\nAbstract: The previous generation of NASA missions to the ou
 ter solar system discovered salt water oceans on Europa and Enceladus\, ea
 ch with more liquid water than Earth – compelling targets to look for ex
 traterrestrial life. Closer to home\, JAXA and NASA have imaged sky-light 
 entrances to lava tube caves on the Moon more than 100 m in diameter and E
 SA has characterized the incredibly varied and complex terrain of Comet 67
 P. While JPL has successfully landed and operated four rovers on the surfa
 ce of Mars using a 6-wheeled rocker-bogie architecture\, future missions w
 ill require new mobility architectures for these extreme environments. Unf
 ortunately\, the highest value science targets often lie in the terrain th
 at is hardest to access. This talk will explore robotic grippers that enab
 le missions to these extreme terrains through their ability to grip a wide
  variety of surfaces (shapes\, sizes\, and geotechnical properties). To pr
 epare for use in space where repair or replacement is not possible\, we fi
 eld-test these grippers and robots in analog extreme terrain on Earth. Man
 y of these systems are enabled by advances in autonomy. The talk will pres
 ent a rapid overview of my work and a detailed case study of an underactua
 ted rock gripper for deflecting asteroids. \n\n\n\nBrief Bio: Dr. Aaron Pa
 rness was the Group Supervisor of the Robotic Grippers and Climbing Robots
  Group at JPL and the head of the Robotic Rapid Prototyping Laboratory. He
  received two bachelor’s degrees from MIT (Mechanical Engineering & Crea
 tive Writing)\, and his MS and PhD from Stanford University. He has led Mo
 on Diver\, a proposed Discovery-class mission that would send a rappelling
  robot into a lunar cave\, and several R&D tasks featuring robotic gripper
 s. His research over the last decade has emphasized iterative design\, rap
 id and novel manufacturing methods\, and field testing. He has led the dev
 elopment of grippers fielded on volcanic terrain in Hawaii’s Volcanoes N
 ational Park\, within ice caves on Mt. Rainier and Mt. St Helens\, and at 
 2\,000 m depth in the Pacific Ocean. He also developed a gecko-inspired ad
 hesive and robotic grippers that flew to the International Space Station\,
  were featured as a Popular Science Top 100 innovation of the year\, and h
 ave been licensed to a startup company selling gecko grippers for pick and
  place applications in the manufacturing space.\n\nHost: David Wettergreen

DESCRIPTION:Abstract: Multi-fingered hands offer autonomous robots increas
 ed dexterity\, versatility\, and stability over simple two-fingered grippe
 rs. Naturally\, this increased ability comes with increased complexity in 
 planning and executing manipulation actions. As such\, I propose combining
  model-based planning with learned components to improve over purely data-
 driven or purely-model based approaches to manipulation. This talk examine
 s multi-fingered autonomous manipulation when the robot has only partial k
 nowledge of the object of interest. I will first present results on planni
 ng multi-fingered grasps for novel objects using a learned neural network.
  I will then present our approach to planning in-hand manipulation tasks w
 hen dynamic properties of objects are not known. I will conclude with a di
 scussion of our ongoing and future research to further unify these two app
 roaches. \nBio: Tucker Hermans is an assistant professor in the School of 
 Computing at the University of Utah\, where he is a founding member of the
  University of Utah Robotics Center. He was a visiting professor at NVIDIA
  Research during summer 2019. Professor Hermans is a recipient of the NSF 
 CAREER award and the 3M Non-Tenured Faculty Award. His research has been n
 ominated for multiple conference paper awards including winning the Best M
 edical Robotics Paper Award at ICRA 2017. Previously\, Professor Hermans w
 as a postdoctoral at TU Darmstadt working with Jan Peters. He was at Georg
 ia Tech from 2009 to 2014 in the School of Interactive Computing where he 
 earned his Ph.D. in Robotics under the supervision of Aaron Bobick and Jim
  Rehg. At Georgia Tech he earned his M.Sc. in Computer Science He earned h

 alk stems from a course called “Banned Books\,” which Dr. Newman has b
 een teaching in the CMU English department for the last 10 years. She has 
 learned from this class that books in the US are most often banned and/or 
 challenged by parents/adults ostensibly on behalf of children\, and the ta
 rget is often children’s and/or young adult literature. The issue of cen
 sorship and banning books is an issue for the field of Children’s Litera
 ture\, and\, ultimately\, it’s an issue of power. In this talk Dr. Newma
 n will feature a few recent incidents in which Children’s literature was
  challenged\, towards some suggestions about how we can think about (and c
 ombat) book banning in a difficult time.<br><a href="goog_1590993670"><br>

DESCRIPTION:Designing Real-time Teacher Augmentation to Combine Strengths 
 of Human and AI Instruction\nKenneth Holstein\n\nTuesday\, September 24th\
 , 10:00am\nGates-Hillman Center (GHC) 6115\n\nCommittee:\nVincent Aleven\,
  Co-Chair (HCII\, CMU)\nBruce M. McLaren\, Co-Chair (HCII\, CMU)\nJodi For
 lizzi (HCII\, CMU)\nPierre Dillenbourg (School of Computer and Communicati
 on Sciences\, EPFL)\nNikol Rummel (Department of Psychology\, RUB & HCII\,
  CMU)\n\nAbstract:\nWhen used in K-12 classrooms\, AI-based educational so
 ftware such as intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) allows students to work
  at their own pace\, while also freeing up the teacher to spend more time 
 working one-on-one with students. A common intuition is that\, in many sit
 uations\, human teachers may be better suited to support students than ITS
 s alone (e.g.\, by providing socio-emotional support\, supporting student 
 motivation\, or flexibly providing conceptual support when further problem
 -solving practice may be ineffective). Yet ITSs are not typically designed
  to work together with teachers during a class session\, to take advantage
  of these complementary strengths. \n\nThis dissertation explores how AI t
 utors might be better designed to work together with human teachers in rea
 l-time\, to amplify teachers’ abilities to help their students. Working 
 together with 36 middle school math teachers\, I conducted the first broad
  exploration in the literature of teachers’ needs for real-time analytic
 s and orchestration support in AI-supported\, personalized classrooms. As 
 part of this work\, I worked with teachers to design a form of real-time\,
  wearable teacher augmentation called Lumilo. \n\nLumilo is a set of mixed
 -reality smart glasses that direct teachers’ attention during a class se
 ssion\, towards situations the tutoring software may be ill-suited to hand
 le on its own\, and support teachers in deciding how best to respond. Lumi
 lo has been used by teachers and students in over 40 middle school classro
 oms so far. An in-vivo classroom experiment showed that teacher–AI co-or
 chestration\, as supported by Lumilo\, enhanced students’ learning compa
 red with an AI-supported classroom in which the teacher did not have such 
 support. \n\nOver the course of this research\, I have also developed new 
 design and prototyping methods to address challenges in the co-design\, ex
 perience prototyping\, and evaluation of data-driven AI systems. To suppor
 t the use of these methods within the area of education\, my collaborators
  and I have extended an existing technical architecture (CTAT/TutorShop) t
 o facilitate rapid prototyping of data-driven educational AI applications.
 \n\nIn the final chapters of this dissertation\, I explore how the concept
 s embodied by Lumilo might be prepared for wider use\, from two angles. Fi
 rst\, I involve students\, as well as teachers\, in the next phase of desi
 gn to better serve the needs and respect the boundaries of both stakeholde
 r groups. Second\, through a newly-formed academic–industry partnership 
 with Carnegie Learning (a major educational AI company) I begin to explore
  how real-time\, wearable teacher augmentation might be generalized to wor
 k with a broader range of AI tutoring systems and curricula.\n\n\nDocument

 the problem of how to characterize mathematical diagrams in the first plac
 e\, and propose a technical definition to delineate the phenomenon under i
 nvestigation.  The focus of the talk is on the features of diagrams that u
 nderwrite their ability to play a role in the inferential structure of cer
 tain proofs. My main thesis is that in some cases not only proof presentat
 ions\, but the proofs themselves are dependent (in a way I will specify) o
 n certain features of the notations they deploy -- I call these constituti
 ve features.  Throughout the talk I use examples of diagrams taken from di
 fferent areas of contemporary mathematics.<br><br><br><br><a href="http://

DESCRIPTION:Chris Barker\, New York University Linguistics<br><br><br>Natu
 ral language imperatives as actions<br><br>Imperatives ("Sit down!") are i
 nstructions for changing the world in a&nbsp\;certain way.  Various logics
  associated with Pratt\, Hoare\, Segerberg\,&nbsp\;and others formalize th
 e behavior of computer programming languages in&nbsp\;terms of actions\, m
 odeled as relations over states.  I will argue that&nbsp\;Segerberg's Dyna
 mic Logic in particular is a promising candidate for describing natural la
 nguage imperatives.  For instance\, "Sit down!" would denote the set of pa
 irs &lt\;a\,b&gt\; such that b is a continuation of a in which the address
 ee of the imperative has sat down.  Then conjoining imperatives correspond
 s to dynamic sequencing\, so that "Sit down and shut up!" is the set of pa
 irs &lt\;a\,c&gt\; such that there is some b with &lt\;a\,b&gt\; in the de
 notation of "Sit down!" and &lt\;b\,c&gt\; in the denotation of "Shut up!"
 .  Disjunctions of imperatives naturally correspond to set union\, which m
 eans that Dynamic Logic validates free choice inferences ("Eat an apple or
  eat a pear" can be obeyed by eating an apple)\, without validating Ross' 
 Paradox (the set of actions denoted by "Mail this letter" will not include
  the set of actions denoted by "Mail this letter or burn it").  The right 
 way to handle negation ("Don't be sad!") is less clear\, but the treatment
  of negation in Krifka's more general conception of speech acts as index s
 pace shifters points the way.<br><br><br><a href="https://www.nyu.edu/proj

DESCRIPTION:Conor Mayo-Wilson\, University of Washington<br><br><br>Title:
   Qualitative Objective Likelihoodism<br><br>Abstract:  In debates about t
 he foundations of statistics\, likelihoodism is roughly the the thesis tha
 t all information about an unknown statistical parameter is contained in t
 he likelihood function.  Although likelihoodists often advertise their met
 hods as more "objective" than Bayesian ones\, the nature of that "objectiv
 ity" is often not entirely clear and its importance even less so.  We firs
 t show that core likelihoodist theses can be understood as characterizing 
 when all Bayesians will agree in different sense.  We then argue that this
  agreement is a better explication of the sense in which likelihoodist met
 hods are objective.  Finally\, we show that the same results extend to qua
 litative probabilistic settings\, in which prior and posterior "probabilit
 ies" are represented by qualitative orderings over the hypothesis and outc
 ome spaces.<br><br><br><br><a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/conormw

DESCRIPTION:World leaders\, CEOs\, and academics have suggested that a rev
 olution in artificial intelligence is upon us. If they are right\, what wi
 ll advances in artificial intelligence mean for international competition 
 and the balance of power? How will it influence moral and ethical issues s
 urrounding international politics? This presentation discusses how develop
 ments in artificial intelligence (AI) — advanced\, narrow applications i
 n particular — could influence power and international politics. As a po
 tentially general purpose technology like electricity or the combustion en
 gine\, AI could have wide-ranging consequences for the world. This is part
 icularly true given that the locus of innovation is coming from the privat
 e sector\, not the defense world. What will this mean for international po
 litics and topics ranging from first mover advantages to ethics and war to
  the balance of power?

DESCRIPTION:Or\,\nLiz Duffy Adams\nDirected by Kim Weild\nNov.14-23\nWe al
 l embody opposites within\nOr else we’re frankly far too dull to live\n
 “Or\,” is a colorful\, energetic\, door-slamming farce (only partiall
 y based on historical fact) that celebrates the emergence of women in the 
 theatre scene. After being released from a debtor’s prison\, Aphra Behn 
 is desperate to leave her life of espionage behind. Aphra’s dreams of wr
 iting for the stage come true when she gets the opportunity to work for on
 e of London’s only two production companies – so long as she can finis
 h writing her play by morning. What seems to be a simple task becomes much
  more complicated when the seductive Nell Gwynne\, the charming King Charl
 es II\, and Aphra’s double-agent ex-boyfriend William Scott get involved
 . Can Aphra make it big as a writer? Or will love\, war\, and gender barri
 ers from past and present catch up to her? Who knew making history would b

  and violently throws her book across the room. \nPainter cries out\, Scho

 April 20-26\n \nWhat you’re born into \nHas a way of catching up with y
 ou. \nEven if you know it’s a lie.\n​\nWe know them by different names
 \, but we remember their stories all the same. Fierce O\, gone\, loved too
  much. Beautiful D\, haunting\, loved against themselves. Bitter I\, stuck
 \, doesn’t taste love. D child knows them by these names\, but doesn’t
  remember the story pumping through their own blood. Desdemona’s Child (
 blood cry) dives into the ruin Othello left behind and the next generation
  struggling to keep afloat. Navigating a sunken past amidst a drowning pre
 sent\, D child seeks to reconcile truth with memory.\nDesdemona’s Child 
 (blood cry) exists in the eye of the storm\, or our bated breath as we wai
 t for the flood to wash over and drown us too. Desdemona’s Child (blood 
 cry) asks of us the same questions D child asks of themselves: How do we s
 urvive histories built on oppression? How do we contend with legacies we
 ’re born into? How do we begin to heal when trauma’s inked into our be
 ing?\n*This production is a developmental iteration of Desdemona’s Child
  and Mansoor’s MFA Thesis.

DESCRIPTION:Desdemona’s Child\nCaridad Svich\nDirected by Adil Mansoor\n
 April 20-26\n \nWhat you’re born into \nHas a way of catching up with y
 ou. \nEven if you know it’s a lie.\n​\nWe know them by different names
 \, but we remember their stories all the same. Fierce O\, gone\, loved too
  much. Beautiful D\, haunting\, loved against themselves. Bitter I\, stuck
 \, doesn’t taste love. D child knows them by these names\, but doesn’t
  remember the story pumping through their own blood. Desdemona’s Child (
 blood cry) dives into the ruin Othello left behind and the next generation
  struggling to keep afloat. Navigating a sunken past amidst a drowning pre
 sent\, D child seeks to reconcile truth with memory.\nDesdemona’s Child 
 (blood cry) exists in the eye of the storm\, or our bated breath as we wai
 t for the flood to wash over and drown us too. Desdemona’s Child (blood 
 cry) asks of us the same questions D child asks of themselves: How do we s
 urvive histories built on oppression? How do we contend with legacies we
 ’re born into? How do we begin to heal when trauma’s inked into our be
 ing?\n*This production is a developmental iteration of Desdemona’s Child
  and Mansoor’s MFA Thesis.
