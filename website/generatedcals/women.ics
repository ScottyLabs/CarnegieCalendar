DESCRIPTION:Paul Gravett is a London-based freelance journalist\, curator\
 , lecturer\, writer\, and broadcaster\, who has worked in comics publishin
 g and promotion since 1981.\n\nIn the early 1980s he manned the Fast Ficti
 on table at the bi-monthly Saturday comic marts held in London's Westminst
 er Hall\, inviting anybody to sell their homemade comics from it\, with al
 l proceeds going to the creator. This role earned him the nickname 'Man At
  The Crossroads' from Eddie Campbell in his graphic novel Alec: How To Be 
 An Artist\, "He will be the purest\, most fresh-faced wee fellow you have 
 ever met. His ingenuous enthusiasm will beam from his cheery countenance."
 \n\nIn 1983 he launched Escape Magazine\, which he co-edited/published wit
 h Peter Stanbury\, showcasing the cream of the alternative cartoonists of 
 the 1980s. Escape lasted for 19 issues before closing its doors in 1989. F
 or six years\, Escape helped to promote an evolving bunch of distinctive B
 ritish creators\, many of whom were quickly picked up by other comics publ
 ishers and by the UK music press\, newspapers\, magazines and galleries. T
 he Comics Journal in #210 said of Escape\, "This now-defunct London based 
 anthology remains one of the most sorely missed comics of all time not sim
 ply because of its tremendous track record of translating European comics 
 but simply because it was always good in so many ways."\n\nUnder the Escap
 e Publishing imprint\, he co-published Violent Cases in 1987\, the first c
 ollaboration between Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean\, three volumes of Eddie 
 Campbell's Alec between 1984 and 1986\, and London's Dark in 1988 by James
  Robinson and Paul Johnson.\n\nBetween 1992 and 2001 he was the director o
 f The Cartoon Art Trust\, a UK charity established in 1988\, dedicated to 
 preserving and promoting the best of British cartoon art and caricature an
 d to establish a museum of cartoon art with gallery\, archives and referen
 ce library.\n\nHe has curated numerous exhibitions of comic art in Britain
  and in Europe\, including 'God Save The Comics!'\, a survey of British co
 mic art at the National Comics and Image Centre in Angoulême\, France and
  the first exhibit devoted to the writer Alan Moore and his collaborators 
 at the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Charleroi\, Belgium. As Project Director o
 f The Cartoon Art Trust in London\, he worked on tributes to Carl Giles an
 d Charles Schulz\, creator of Peanuts\, and The 100 British Cartoonists of
  the Century. His subsequent exhibitions have included retrospectives of J
 ack Kirby at the Fumetto Festival in Lucerne\, and of Tove Jansson and Pos
 y Simmonds at the Belgian Comics Art Museum in Brussels.\n\nSince 2003\, P
 aul has been the director of Comica\, the London International Comics Fest
 ival\, initially at the Institute of Contemporary Arts. From 2011 to 2017\
 , Comica became an independent not-for-profit organisation running both th
 e annual festival and other events and exhibitions throughout the year. Cu
 rrently\, Comica continues to run the monthly meet-up\, Comica Social Club
 \, and the annual Graphic Short Story Prize and finalists’ exhibition in
  association with The Observer and Jonathan Cape Graphic Novels.\n\nPaul i

 o-author\, with Peter Stanbury\, of Graphic Novels: Stories To Change Your
  Life (2005)\, Great British Comics: Celebrating A Century Of Ripping Yarn

 evision he has been a consultant and interview subject on The South Bank S
 how's programme Manga Mania (2006) and BBC4's documentary series Comics Br
 itannia (2007). Also\, he appeared as an interview subject in the DVD docu
 mentary The Mindscape Of Alan Moore (2007). He is regularly interviewed ab
 out British and international comics for the BBC\, Sky News\, Channel 4 Ne
 ws\, France Culture\, TRT World and others.\n\nHe continues to write about
