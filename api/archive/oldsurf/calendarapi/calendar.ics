 n\n        \n          \n  \n\nAI has the potential to automate people out
  of their jobs\, and in some cases\, it will. But while we should carefull
 y consider the risk of replacing human capabilities\, it’s important to re
 alize that AI has enormous potential to augment them as well: it can boost
  the creativity of our work\, help us learn better\, deliver healthcare mo
 re effectively\, and make our societies more sustainable. Like any tool\, 
 however\, our relationship with AI has as much to do with its interface as
  it does with the underlying capabilities it provides. Does it amplify our
  actions and remain attentive to our goals—even as we revise them—or is it
  a black box that accomplishes tasks autonomously? If we want to build a f
 uture of open possibility and empowerment\, it’s vital that our ability to
  harness AI evolves alongside AI itself. I will illustrate how we are addr
 essing grand challenges in fields like health and education by building sy
 stems that balance innovative user interfaces with intelligent systems.

 \n\n \n\nAbstract:\n\nCivil discourse is our most basic form of civic enga
 gement. In a democracy\, it is our best tool for collectively answering a 
 society's most fundamental question: 'What shall we do?' While most us hav
 e no doubt participated in political discussions\, engaging in civil disco
 urse that is productive (i.e.\, dialogue that fosters democratic goals) ca
 n be substantially more difficult. For example\, when both sides of an arg
 ument view their beliefs as part of their identity\, debating the merits o
 f those beliefs without calling into question the merits of the individual
 s who hold them can be challenging. Ideally\, a careful discussant might f
 ind common ground\, previously obscured by the trappings of tribalism\, or
 \, at the very least\, foster a mutual understanding of and respect for th
 e values that inform beliefs they do not share. On the other hand\, an uns
 killed discussant\, perhaps one only interested in personal attacks or 'wi
 nning arguments\,' will likely only further entrench each party in the vie
 ws of their political tribe.\n\n\nEngaging in productive civil discourse i
 s a skill that needs to be explicitly taught\, modeled\, and practiced in 
 the same way that students are taught and given opportunities to practice 
 skills like finding the length of the hypotenuse or filling in a Punnett s
 quare. Unfortunately\, civic education often takes a backseat to so-called
  core subjects like math\, science\, and English. We propose a novel civic
  education intervention designed to provide students with 1) a better unde
 rstanding of the values that shape their own beliefs and the beliefs of ot
 hers\, 2) opportunities to practice overcoming the biases that are born ou
 t our pre-existing beliefs\, 3) an understanding of what makes civil disco
 urse productive and examples of model civil discourse\, and 4) opportuniti
 es to practice the skills that underpin productive civil discourse. Our pr
 oposed intervention is an AI-powered educational game that adapts instruct
 ion to a student’s specific values. This value-adaptive instruction is cri
 tical because it uniquely allows students to more effectively practice ski
 lls like political perspective taking\, identifying personal biases\, and 
 engaging in discussions that foster democratic goals.\n\n \n\nLink to Prop

 \n          \n  \n\nAgentic technologies are increasingly emerging in intr
 insically social settings\; yet\, the social capacities of such systems re
 main critically deficient. Lacking the ability to navigate antisocial dyna
 mics in particular\, artificial agents have profound potential to cause ha
 rm. For example\, Microsoft’s chatbot Tay - having spent one day on Twitte
 r - morphed from the cheery teenage girl persona with which it was deploye
 d into an unabashed proponent of White and male supremacy. While Tay’s rad
 icalization stemmed from the toxic disinhibition of the bot’s interlocutor
 s\, it was Tay’s inability to recognize aggression that enabled the transf
 ormation.\n\n\nIn this talk\, I will discuss my recent empirical work to h
 ighlight several ways in which design that is agnostic or inattentive to h
 uman social dynamics can foster antisociality in human-agent interactions.
  In particular\, I will discuss the consequences of hyper-anthropomorphiza
 tion - from aversion reflected by the uncanny valley to animosity present 
 in people's objectification of humanlike robots - and broader consideratio
 ns\, both negative (e.g.\, capacity of agentic technologies to exacerbate 
 social marginalization) and positive (e.g.\, capacity to promote prosocial
  dynamics)\, toward improving the sociality of future systems.        \n

 escription\n        \n          \n  \n\nResearch on Human-robot Interactio
 n to date has largely focused on examining a single human interacting with
  a single robot. This work has led to advances in fundamental understandin
 g about the psychology of human-robot interaction (e.g. how specific desig
 n choices affect interactions with and attitudes towards robots) and about
  the effective design of human-robot interaction (e\,g. how novel mechanis
 ms or computational tools can be used to improve HRI).  However\, the sing
 le-robot-single-human focus of this growing body of work stands in stark c
 ontrast to the complex social contexts in which robots are increasingly pl
 aced. While robots increasingly support teamwork across a wide range of se
 ttings covering search and rescue missions\, minimally invasive surgeries\
 , space exploration missions\, or manufacturing\, we have limited understa
 nding of how groups people will interact with robots and how robots will a
 ffect how people interact with each other in groups and teams. In this tal
 k I present empirical findings from several studies that show how robots c
 an shape in direct but also subtle ways how people interact and collaborat
 e with each other in teams.        \n                    Speaker's Bio\n

 ests for use of our personal data\, nor clear solution for designers who w
 ish to incorporate privacy management at the core of their products and se
 rvices. At a time when platforms such as Facebook are under scrutiny for h
 ow they use personal data\, a self-sovereign agent can begin to rectify th
 e vast asymmetry of power between the platform and the data subject.\n\n\n
 Self-sovereign agent technology has a fiduciary relationship with the huma
 n subject that mirrors the relationship a physician has with a patient. Id
 entity that is exposed by a self-sovereign agent is designed to minimize t
 he leakage of personal information as individuals engage with other people
  and entities\, both public and private. However\, the cost of managing pe
 rsonal information “manually” for each of the dozens and hundreds of entit
 ies we encounter every week is unsustainable. Therefore\, individuals need
  a way to automate the vast majority of decisions that are directly linked
  to their identity\, inviting the integration of AI as a decision agent in
 to the design of human-computer systems. Machine learning could balance th
 e social intent with the privacy of interactions that we typically reserve
  for our real-time\, conscious selves in a conversation.\n\n\nIt could be 
 argued that privacy is now a limiting factor in computer science. This tal
 k is about the interaction between self-sovereign identity and self-sovere
 ign technology standards using examples from health records and “connected
  home” IoT devices.        \n                    Speaker's Bio\n        \n
           \n  \n\nAdrian Gropper\, MD is CTO of the non-profit Patient Pri
 vacy Rights Foundation where he brings training as an engineer from MIT an
 d physician from Harvard Medical School followed by a career as a medical 
 device entrepreneur. He founded three regulated medical diagnostics busine
 sses including AMICAS\, the first Web-based radiology image network and th
 e first to provide imaging links in electronic health records. He particip
 ated in the founding of many healthcare interoperability initiatives inclu
 ding Blue Button\, Direct Project\, and Health Relationship Trust (HEART) 
 and he speaks frequently on privacy engineering in health care. His paper 
 won a prize at ONC’s 2016 Blockchain Health competition. His current proje
 ct\, Trustee by HIE of One (Health Information Exchange of One)\, uses pub
 lic blockchains\, standards\, and free software to enable patient-controll
 ed independent health records that can span a lifetime. This reference imp
 lementation informs emerging blockchain standards development for identity
 \, credentials\, and reputation with groups that include W3C\, IEEE\, Kant
 ara\, OpenID Foundation\, and others.        \n                    Speaker
