 anuary! We've recently rebranded with a cool new name: MIT Reality Hack\n
 \n\n\nMIT Reality Hack is a 5 day event held every January that comprises 
 of thought leaders\, brand mentors and creators\, participants\, students\
 , and technology lovers to come together and attend tech workshops\, talks
 \, discussions\, fireside chats\, collaborations\, hacking\, and more. Par
 ticipants of various backgrounds and all skill levels attend from all over
  the world.\n	\n	Reality Hack starts with workshops and bringing together 
 teams. Hacking then takes over for 3 days\, with mentors\, hardware\, and 
 snacks to guide the way. It culminates in judging and a public expo to bri
 ng to light some of the amazing projects and ideas developed.\n\n\n\nLast 
 year we hosted over 400 hackers representing a diverse cohort of new and
  experienced XR creators. This event provides a great opportunity for a
 ttendees to develop fresh ideas\, make new connections in the industry\, a
 nd build on the latest hardware and tools from company sponsors. \n\n\nh

 lways played a central role in neuroscientific experimentation and theoriz
 ing. Historically\, Nissl and Golgi staining methods were crucial to allow
 ing researchers to produce data bearing on the neuron doctrine. More recen
 tly\, the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (B
 RAIN) initiative\, launched by former President Barack Obama and carried o
 ut with support from the NIH\, NSF\, DARPA\, and IARPA\, has directed reso
 urces into the development of new technologies in the hope that it will im
 prove\, or even revolutionize\, our understanding of the brain. Additional
 ly\, new computational technologies potentially give insight into understa
 nding how to link behaviour to neuroscience in ways that many hope will im
 pact clinical practice.<br /> <br />The aim of this workshop is to explor
 e how tools and technology have advanced neuroscience and cognitive scienc
 e and consider their epistemological and broader philosophical implication
 s. We are inviting abstract submissions linked to the workshop’s main qu
 estions:<br />1)    How are new technologies in neuroscience assessed an
 d revised?<br />2)    How have new technologies in neuroscience advanced
  debates in (philosophy of) cognitive science?<br /><br />We welcome any a
 bstracts related to the overall theme of the workshop on tools and technol
 ogy in neuroscience though preference may be given to those that directly 
 address the main questions. In delimiting what counts as technology\, we i
 nclude both instruments and devices that can be portable to different expe
 rimental contexts\, but also techniques\, protocols and modelling tools. E
 xamples could include (but are not limited to): CLARITY\, Scale\, SeeDB\, 
 fMRI\, Deep Brain Stimulation\, text/data mining methods\, connectomics\, 
 MVPA\, machine learning\, Brain-computer interfaces\, DREADDs\, optogeneti
 cs and TMS. We hope this workshop encourages a substantive dialogue betwee
 n researchers in neuroscience/cognitive science and philosophy. To facilit
 ate this\, each contributed talk will be paired with a commentator who is 
 a senior faculty member in philosophy/neuroscience as appropriate.</span><

DESCRIPTION:<p><em><span style='font-size: 14pt\;'>The search for topologi
 cal phases of matter</span></em><br /><br />In our daily lives\, we encoun
 ter phases of matter distinguished by the symmetries they break\, such as 
 steam and ice. Such phases are well-understood with very established theor
 y of Ginzburg and Landau\, suggesting the work to characterize and underst
 and phases of matter might be close to completion. In the 1980's\, however
 \, physicists were confronted with the integer and fractional quantum Hall
  effects\, phases of matter that cannot be distinguished from one another 
 by symmetry-breaking. Instead\, these phases are distinguished by topologi
 cal invariants: they display signatures that are unaffected by sufficientl
 y small perturbations (topological signatures)\, that we can measure with 
 remarkable accuracy. In the intervening decades\, the set of topological p
 hases of matter has expanded dramatically\, with tremendous potential for 
 applications from table-top study of high-energy physics to topologically-
 protected quantum computation. Considerable work remains\, however\, not j
 ust to understand the topological phases we have already found\, but in si
 mply finding the rest! In this talk\, I will discuss some recently-discove
 red topological phases of matter\, the magnetic topological Kondo semimeta
 l phases\, the higher-order topological phases\, and the topological skyrm
 ion phases\, to introduce this wide-ranging and increasingly important fie
 ld of research.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p><strong><em>Deep Fictitious Play for Stochastic Differentia
 l Games</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Differential game
 s\, as an offspring of game theory and optimal control\, provide the model
 ing and analysis of conflict in the context of a dynamical system. Computi
 ng Nash equilibria is one of the core objectives in differential games\, w
 ith a major bottleneck coming from the notorious intractability of N-playe
 r games\, also known by the curse of dimensionality. To overcome this diff
 iculty\, we apply the idea of fictitious play to design deep neural networ
 ks (DNNs)\, and develop deep learning theory and algorithms\, for which we
  refer as deep fictitious play. The resulted deep learning algorithm is sc
 alable\, parallelizable and model-free. We illustrate the performance of p
 roposed algorithms by comparing them to the closed-form solution of the li
 near-quadratic game. We also prove the convergence of the fictitious play 
 under appropriate assumptions and verify that the convergent limit forms a
 n open-loop Nash equilibrium. Based on the formulation by backward stochas
 tic differential equations\, we extend the strategy of deep fictitious pla
 y to compute closed-loop Markovian Nash equilibrium for both homogeneous a
 nd heterogeneous large N-player games.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> refr

DESCRIPTION:<p><em><strong>When and How Fracture Nucleates and Propagates 
 in Rubber</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Twenty years in
  since their introduction\, it is now plain that the regularized formulati
 ons dubbed as phase-field of the variational theory of brittle fracture of
  Francfort and Marigo (1998) provide a powerful macroscopic theory to desc
 ribe and predict the propagation of cracks in (linear and non-linear) elas
 tic brittle materials under arbitrary quasistatic loading conditions. Over
  the past ten years\, the ability of the phase-field approach to also poss
 ibly describe and predict crack nucleation has been under intense investig
 ation.</p>\n<p>The first of two objectives of this talk is to establish th
 at the existing phase-field approach to fracture at large — irrespective
 ly of its particular version — is fundamentally incomplete to model crac
 k nucleation. This is because the approach is purely energetic and cannot 
 account for one essential ingredient that is not energetic but rather stre
 ss-based: the strength of the material.</p>\n<p>The second objective is to
  introduce — in the general context of finite elasticity — an amendmen
 t that renders a phase-field theory capable of modeling crack nucleation i
 n general\, be it from large pre-existing cracks\, small pre-existing crac
 ks\, smooth and non-smooth boundary points\, or within the bulk of structu
 res subjected to arbitrary quasistatic loadings. The central idea is to im
 plicitly account for the presence of the inherent microscopic defects in t
 he material — whose defining macroscopic manifestation is precisely the 
 strength of the material — through the addition of an external driving f
 orce in the equation governing the evolution of the phase field.</p>\n<p>T
 o illustrate the descriptive and predictive capabilities of the proposed t
 heory\, the last part of the talk will be devoted to deploy the theory to 
 simulate the nucleation and propagation of fracture in a class of conspicu
 ous experiments\, that of rubber bands subject to tensile loading. The sim
 ulations for very short rubber bands will explain the famous poker-chip ex
 periments of Gent and Lindley (1959)\, whereas those for long rubber bands
  will explain when and how the famed rubber bands invented by Stephen Perr
 y in the 1840s break.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p><strong><em>Wasserstein metric and its financial applicatio
 ns</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The talk is concerned 
 with the Wasserstein metric and contains three parts. Motivated by the mod
 el-independent pricing of exotic options that is formulated in terms of th
 e martingale optimal transport\, we provide in the first part a computatio
 nal method as well as its convergence rate using the Wasserstein metric. I
 n the second part\, we consider an optimization problem originating from a
 n optimal urban planning problem\, where the objective function is given b
 y a parameterized semi-discrete Wasserstein distance. It appears that this
  optimization problem shares the common formulatation with the so-called W
 asserstein GAN (Generative Adversarial Network). In contrast to the gradie
 nt methods\, we adopt Lloyd's algorithm to solve this optimization problem
  and investigate its convergence. The last part is based on a recent work 
 that is related to two variants: sliced Wasserstein metric and max-sliced 
 Wasserstein metric. We prove that the max-sliced Wasserstein metric (of or
 der 1) is strongly equivalent to the Wasserstein metric\, while the sliced
  Wasserstein metric does not share this nice property.</p>\n<p><strong>Not

DESCRIPTION:<p><span style='font-size: 14pt\;'><em>Searching for TeV Scale
  Physics in Precision Electroweak Measurements</em></span></p>\n<p>In anal
 ogy to their electromagnetic charge\, protons and electrons carry a weak c
 harge that describes the strength of their interactions with electroweak Z
  bosons. Thanks to an accidental suppression in the Standard Model of Part
 icle Physics\, these weak charges are nearly zero and therefore sensitive 
 to unsuppressed effects from physics beyond the Standard Model. Measuring 
 these weak charges is all but easy: their effects in elastic electron scat
 tering are at the level of parts per billion compared to the electromagnet
 ic interaction. Over the past decades we have perfected techniques to acce
 ss the tiny effect of Z boson exchange diagrams in parity-violating electr
 on scattering. By scattering electron beams with alternating helicity from
  the proton or electrons in fixed targets at Jefferson Lab\, we can measur
 e the tiny helicity asymmetries which give us access to the weak charge. W
 e rely on precise control of beam parameters\, accurate understanding of b
 ackground process\, and fast integrating electronics. In 2018\, the Qweak 
 experiment made the first determination of the weak charge of the proton\,
  in agreement with Standard Model predictions. Now we are developing the M

 pintronics: Towards integrated magneto-photonics</em></span></p>\n<p>Novel
  schemes for optically controlling ferromagnetic order at a femtosecond ti
 me scale receive great scientific interest. In the strongly non-equilibriu
 m regime\, it has become possible not only to quench magnetic order\, but 
 even to deterministically switch the magnetic state by a single femtosecon
 d laser pulses. Moreover\, it has been shown that pulsed laser excitation 
 can induce spin currents over several to tens of nanometers. This developm
 ent triggered a merge of the fields of ‘femto-magnetism’ and spintroni
 cs – opening up a fascinating playground for novel physical phenomena. I
 n this lecture I will discuss the underlying principles\, but also envisio
 n their exploitation in THz magnonics and integrated spintronic-photonic m
 emories.</p>\n<p>After a brief review of the field\, mechanisms for ultraf
 ast loss of magnetic order upon fs laser heating as well as all-optical sw
 itching will be explained. Next\, different processes that give rise to la
 ser-induced spin currents will be distinguished. In particular I will addr
 ess experiments that have demonstrated laser-induced spin transfer torque 
 on a free magnetic layer. These fs spin currents are absorbed within a few
  nanometers\, providing ideal conditions for exciting and exploring THz sp
 in waves. Finally\, it will be argued that synthetic\, layered ferrimagnet
 s provide an ideal platform for combining fs optical control with advanced
  spintronic functionality. It will be shown how magnetic bits can be writt
 en ‘on-the-fly’ by fs laser pulses in a so-called magnetic racetrack\,
  where they are immediately transported by a dc current. Such schemes may 
 lead to a novel class of integrated photonics\, in which information is tr
 ansferred back and forth between the photonic and magnetic domain without 
 any intermediate electronic steps.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Biography:

DESCRIPTION:<p><em><strong>Spatially inhomogeneous evolutionary games and 
 applications to social dynamics with label switching</strong></em></p>\n<p
 ><strong>Abstract:</strong> We study an interaction model of a large popul
 ation of players based on an evolutionary game\, which describes the dynam
 ical process of how the distribution of strategies changes in time accordi
 ng to their individual success. We assume that the population of players i
 s distributed over a state space and that they are each endowed with proba
 bility distributions of pure strategies\, which they draw at random to evo
 lve their states. Simultaneously\, the mixed strategies evolve according t
 o a replicator dynamics\, modeling the success of pure strategies accordin
 g to a payoff functional. We establish existence\, uniqueness\, and stabil
 ity of Lagrangian and Eulerian solutions of this dynamical game by using m
 ethods of ODE and optimal transport on Banach spaces. We apply the general
  theoretical framework to perform the mean-field analysis of a multi-popul
 ation agent-based model\, where a particle dynamics derived by a nonlocal 
 velocity and a Markov-type jump process for the labels are coupled.</p>\n<

DESCRIPTION:<p><strong>TITLE: </strong>Nonclassical minimizing oriented su
 rfaces <strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Consider
  a smooth closed simple curve $\\Gamma$ in a given Riemannian manifold. Fo
 llowing the classical work of Douglas and Rado it can be shown that\, give
 n any natural numberg\, there is an oriented surface which bounds $\\Gamma
 $ and has least area among all surfaces with genus at most g. Obviously as
  we increasegthe area of the corresponding minimizer can only decrease. If
 the ambient manifold has dimension 3 and the curve is sufficiently regular
 \, works of De Giorgi and Hardt and Simon guarantee that such number stabi
 lizes\, in other words theabsolute (oriented) minimizer has finite topolog
 y. In a joint work with Guido De Philippis and Jonas Hirsch we show that t
 he latter property might fail in higher codimension even ifthe curve is $C
 ^\\infty$. Some results point instead to its validity for analytic curves 
 (and analyticambient metrics)\, confirming a conjecture of Brian White. <

 jectives requires capabilities such as speed\, precision\, coordination\, 
 reach\, persistence\, lethality\, and endurance – all of which can be en
 hanced through investments in emerging technologies\, such as autonomy and
  artificial intelligence. This talk will present an analysis of U.S. milit
 ary investments in basic\, applied\, and advanced research on autonomous a
 nd AI-enabled weapons and systems\, discuss the benefits\, risks\, and imp

 a parte (Everything Elsewhere\, Seix Barral\, 2005)\, the short stories Po

 appeared in magazines and anthologies in Latin America\, the United States
  and Spain. Between 2009 and 2012 she held a Sunday column in the newspape
 r ‘El Espectador’. Currently\, she publishes a monthly column in the m
 agazine ‘Arcadia’. She obtained a Ph.D in Hispanic Literature from Yal
 e University where she specialized in medieval literature. She also has wo
 rked as a translator and a professor at the State University of New York-P
 urchase College and in the Universidad de los Andes\, in Colombia.\nhttps:
 //www.viclit.com/en/carolina-sanin-2/\n\nAlba Triana's work emerges from a
  deep interest in how nature intrinsically operates. Universal laws of cha
 nce\, and natural behaviors and phenomena frame her approach to art/music 
 making. She engages in creative methods that are holistic\, complex\, and 
 multidimensional\, crossing the boundaries of a diverse set of fields. \n\
 nHer artistic production is hybrid and takes a variety of forms\, includin
 g interactive musical installations\, resonating spaces\, sound and light 
 sculptures\, and vibrational objects. These pieces\, expressed in both spa
 ce and time\, are heard\, walked through\, and seen. \n\nIn the past 10 ye
 ars\, the fields of the sonic and the visual have become unified in her wo
 rk\, exploring interactions among different types of waves\, as well as re
 sonance phenomena in acoustic spaces and physical bodies that emit sound a
 nd/or light. Most recently\, she has experimented with electromagnetism as
  a means of observation of non-perceptible entities.\nhttps://www.albatria

DESCRIPTION:Paul Gravett is a London-based freelance journalist\, curator\
 , lecturer\, writer\, and broadcaster\, who has worked in comics publishin
 g and promotion since 1981.\n\nIn the early 1980s he manned the Fast Ficti
 on table at the bi-monthly Saturday comic marts held in London's Westminst
 er Hall\, inviting anybody to sell their homemade comics from it\, with al
 l proceeds going to the creator. This role earned him the nickname 'Man At
  The Crossroads' from Eddie Campbell in his graphic novel Alec: How To Be 
 An Artist\, "He will be the purest\, most fresh-faced wee fellow you have 
 ever met. His ingenuous enthusiasm will beam from his cheery countenance."
 \n\nIn 1983 he launched Escape Magazine\, which he co-edited/published wit
 h Peter Stanbury\, showcasing the cream of the alternative cartoonists of 
 the 1980s. Escape lasted for 19 issues before closing its doors in 1989. F
 or six years\, Escape helped to promote an evolving bunch of distinctive B
 ritish creators\, many of whom were quickly picked up by other comics publ
 ishers and by the UK music press\, newspapers\, magazines and galleries. T
 he Comics Journal in #210 said of Escape\, "This now-defunct London based 
 anthology remains one of the most sorely missed comics of all time not sim
 ply because of its tremendous track record of translating European comics 
 but simply because it was always good in so many ways."\n\nUnder the Escap
 e Publishing imprint\, he co-published Violent Cases in 1987\, the first c
 ollaboration between Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean\, three volumes of Eddie 
 Campbell's Alec between 1984 and 1986\, and London's Dark in 1988 by James
  Robinson and Paul Johnson.\n\nBetween 1992 and 2001 he was the director o
 f The Cartoon Art Trust\, a UK charity established in 1988\, dedicated to

 ce library.\n\nHe has curated numerous exhibitions of comic art in Britain
  and in Europe\, including 'God Save The Comics!'\, a survey of British co
 mic art at the National Comics and Image Centre in Angoulême\, France and
  the first exhibit devoted to the writer Alan Moore and his collaborators 
 at the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Charleroi\, Belgium. As Project Director o
 f The Cartoon Art Trust in London\, he worked on tributes to Carl Giles an
 d Charles Schulz\, creator of Peanuts\, and The 100 British Cartoonists of
  the Century. His subsequent exhibitions have included retrospectives of J
 ack Kirby at the Fumetto Festival in Lucerne\, and of Tove Jansson and Pos
 y Simmonds at the Belgian Comics Art Museum in Brussels.\n\nSince 2003\, P
 aul has been the director of Comica\, the London International Comics Fest
 ival\, initially at the Institute of Contemporary Arts. From 2011 to 2017\
 , Comica became an independent not-for-profit organisation running both th
 e annual festival and other events and exhibitions throughout the year. Cu
 rrently\, Comica continues to run the monthly meet-up\, Comica Social Club
 \, and the annual Graphic Short Story Prize and finalists’ exhibition in
  association with The Observer and Jonathan Cape Graphic Novels.\n\nPaul i

 \nThe big challenge in selling innovation to healthcare is the misalignmen
 t \nof payment incentives exacerbated by a period of transition from \nfee
 -for-service to value-based care. Design a system to deliver better \npati
 ent care at a lower cost – you may have just reduced hospital revenue. \
 nTarget the insurers who realize the savings – they cannot always influe
 nce \ncare delivery.\nAll of this is complicated by the time required to p
 rove innovation in this \nmarket – the clinician who values the innovati
 on is not the financial \ndecision maker who can approve adoption. The CFO
  wants evidence of savings \n– from proposal to white paper can be a 3-4
  year cycle. Many healthcare \ninnovators burn through their funding befor
 e the puzzle is solved.
